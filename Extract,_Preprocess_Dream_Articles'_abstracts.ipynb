Although double blind analysis of dream reports is assumed \\nto be the most accurate method of quantifying dream bizarreness, contextual \\nfactors can only be clarified by the dreamer themselves, since only they can \\njudge whether an event would be bizarre in their own lives, however the dreamer \\nmight find elements bizarre after waking that they did not find unusual during \\nthe dream.

The risk ratio (RR) for \\nconversion at two years was significantly different from unity (0.67; 95% \\nconfidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.83), but this is based on only two studies \\nreported in the same article. There was essentially no effect of cholinesterase \\ninhibitors on cognitive test scores.Based on the results from 4207 individuals, \\nthere were significantly more adverse events in the cholinesterase inhibitor \\ngroups (RR 1.09; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.16), but no more serious adverse events or \\ndeaths. Gastrointestinal side effects were much more common (diarrhoea: RR 2.10; \\n95% CI 1.30 to 3.39; nausea: RR 2.97; 95% CI 2.57 to 3.42; vomiting: RR 4.42; \\n95% CI 3.23 to 6.05). Cardiac problems were no more likely in either group (RR \\n0.71; 95% CI 0.25 to 2.02). Other side effects reported significantly more often \\nin the cholinesterase inhibitor group were muscle spasms/leg cramps (RR 7.52; \\n95% CI 4.34 to 13.02), headache (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.71), syncope or \\ndizziness (RR 1.62; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.93), insomnia (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.36 to \\n2.02) and abnormal dreams (RR 4.25; 95% CI 2.57 to 7.04).\\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very little evidence that cholinesterase \\ninhibitors affect progression to dementia or cognitive test scores in mild \\ncognitive impairment. This weak evidence is overwhelmed by the increased risk of \\nadverse events, particularly gastrointestinal. Cholinesterase inhibitors should \\nnot be recommended for mild cognitive impairment.\"],\n",

This review aims to investigate the clinical utility \\nof the NIPE.\\nMETHODS: Two investigators screened Pubmed/Medline and Google Scholar for \\nrelevant studies, independently. One investigator extracted data, which were \\nreviewed by a second investigator.\\nRESULTS: The NIPE was used during/after painful stimuli (6 studies), in the \\ncontext of general anaesthesia (2 studies), and for comfort assessment (6 \\nstudies). A) Evaluation of procedural pain/distress: 2 studies reported that the \\nmean-NIPE could be used for reliable monitoring of prolonged pain, and one study \\nreported the association between instant-NIPE and pain after a stimulus but the \\ninstant-NIPE represents the NIPE average over 3\\xa0min. Two studies found no \\ncorrelation between the NIPE and comfort behavior/pain scales, but they mainly \\ndiffered in patients' gestational age and evaluation methodology. B) There are \\nonly 2 studies for the evaluation of nociception during surgery under general \\nanaesthesia with contradictory results. C) Studies assessing neonates' comfort \\nreported increased NIPE scores during skin-to-skin contact and during \\nfacilitated tucking associated with a human voice. No effect on NIPE scores of \\nfacilitated tucking during echocardiography was reported in preterm infants. One \\nstudy reported significantly different NIPE scores with 2 surfactant therapy \\nprotocols. Overall, study populations were small and heterogeneous.\\nCONCLUSION: The results regarding NIPE's performances differ between studies. \\nGiven the limited number of studies and the heterogeneous outcomes, more studies \\nare required to confirm the NIPE usefulness in the different clinical settings.\"],\n",

Running the \\nreaction at O2 -limited conditions at up to 500-ml scale (10% dimethyl \\nsulfoxide; silicone antifoam), we developed a substrate feeding strategy based \\non O2 feedback control. Thus, we achieved high reaction rates of 1.86g·L-1 ·hr-1 \\nand near complete conversion (≥90%) of 80mM (16g/L) C12:0 with good selectivity \\n(≤5% overoxidation).

              " ['Animals have evolved an incredible diversity of sensory systems to extract \\ninformation from the environment. Of these, the chemosensory systems allow them \\nto extract information from their chemical environments, so that behavioral \\npreferences are elicited in response to stimuli that may be aversive or \\nattractive. Animals live in complex environments where an infinite variety of \\nchemical molecules may be encountered. These may be present as single chemicals, \\nor as complex mixtures, where the relative concentrations of individual \\ncomponents differ. The tasks commonly carried out by the olfactory system \\ninclude detection of odors, estimating their strength, identifying their source, \\nand recognizing a specific odor in the background of another. The olfactory \\nsystem in mammals is involved in physiological regulation, emotional responses \\n(e.g., anxiety, fear, pleasure), reproductive functions (e.g., sexual and \\nmaternal behaviors), and social behaviors (e.g., recognition of members of the \\nsame species, family, clan, or outsiders). In insects such as the honeybee, it \\nhas been shown that scents modify behaviors associated with mating, foraging, \\nrecognition of kin, brood care, swarming, alarm, and defense (Reinhard and \\nSrinivasanand 2009). Figure 1.1 shows a diagram of the olfactory epithelium of a \\nmammal. Olfactory receptor neurons are bipolar, and from the apical side, cilia \\ncontaining membrane-bound olfactory receptor proteins lie in an aqueous \\nenvironment (mucus) overlying the epithelium. Odorant molecules need to \\npartition from air into water before they can reach the transduction sites in \\nthe epithelium. Soluble odorant binding proteins are secreted into the aqueous \\nmucus layer, and these may have an odorant carrier and preconcentration role. \\nOver the last century, ideas that several classes of olfactory receptors exist, \\nselective to chemical species on the basis of molecular size, shape, and charge, \\nwere based on evidence from chemistry (Beets 1978), olfactory psychophysics, and \\nstructure-activity relationships of odorants (Boelens 1974), together with the \\nexamination of “specific anosmias” in the human population, which all supported \\nthe definition of selectivity and specificity of putative olfactory receptors \\ninitiated by Amoore (1962a, 1962b, 1967). These were confirmed by developments \\nin olfactory neurobiology and molecular genetics (Buck and Axel 1991; Buck \\n1997a, 1997b; Chess et al. 1992; Mombaerts et al. 1996a). The ideas that several \\nclasses of olfactory receptors exist, selective to chemical species on the basis \\nof molecular size, shape, and charge, also pointed to individual olfactory \\nreceptors being rather broad in their selectivity to molecules within certain \\nclasses. The important molecular parameters of an odorant determining the \\nolfactory response would include the adsorption and desorption energies of the \\nmolecule from air to a receptor interface, partition coefficients, and electron \\ndonor-acceptor interactions, depending on the polarizability of the molecule, \\nand its molecular size and shape. The plethora of chemicals that an animal can \\nsense, as well as their combinatorial and temporal variability, has made it \\ndifficult to understand how the brain processes the incoming information so that \\nan animal can make sense of its chemical environment. Polak (1973) proposed a \\nmultiple profile–multiple receptor site model for vertebrate olfaction \\nanticipating some of the combinatorial coding mechanisms later discovered. The \\nidentification of odorant receptor (OR) genes in rodents (Buck and Axel 1991), \\nin Caenorhabditis elegans (Sengupta et al. 1996), and in Drosophila melanogaster \\n(Clyne et al. 1999; Gao and Chess 1999) have given us a fundamental \\nunderstanding of olfactory coding, especially at the olfactory receptor neuron \\n(ORN) level. Individual ORs are proteins that traverse the cell membrane of the \\ncilia of the olfactory neuron. It appears that there may be hundreds of odorant \\nreceptors, but only one (or at most a few) expressed in each olfactory receptor \\nneuron. These families of proteins may be encoded by as many as 1000 different \\ngenes in humans. This is a large number and accounts for about 2% of the human \\ngenome. In humans, however, most are inactive pseudogenes, and only around 350 \\ncode for functional receptors. There are many more functional genes in \\nmacrosmatic animals like rats. These receptor proteins are members of a \\nwell-known receptor family called the seven-transmembrane domain \\nG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (see Figure 1.2). The hydrophobic regions \\n(the transmembrane parts) contain maximum sequence homology to other members of \\nthe G-protein-linked receptor family. There are some notable features of these \\nolfactory receptors, like the divergence in sequence in the third, fourth, and \\nfifth transmembrane domains, that suggest how a large number of different \\nodorants may be discriminated (Pilpel and Lancet 1999). As crystallographic \\ninformation on olfactory receptors is lacking, they have been modeled based on \\ntheir resemblance to rhodopsin. Gelis et al. (2012) has published models of \\nputative binding sites of some human olfactory receptors. On the inner side of \\nthe cell membrane, proteins called G-proteins are associated with olfactory \\nreceptor. These bind the guanine nucleotides—guanine triphosphate and guanine \\ndiphosphate. They are made up of three subunits and are located with the inner \\nsurface of the plasma membrane. They are closely associated with the \\ntransmembrane receptor protein. When an odorant binds, it is thought that an \\nallosteric change in conformation occurs, in turn causing a conformational \\nchange in a subunit of the G-protein Gα—displacing bound guanine triphosphate \\n(GTP) and allowing it to bind GTP. This in turn produces an activated subunit \\nthat dissociates from the other subunits and activates another effector \\nmolecule, triggering a cascade of events that leads to the opening of an ion \\nchannel, and change of electrical potential across the cell membrane. As this \\nelectrical potential propagates to the basal side of the cell, it triggers in \\nturn voltage-gated ion channels so that a series of electrical spikes results, \\nwhich are transmitted to the processing centers in the brain via the axon of the \\nolfactory neuron. Our understanding is that mammalian and insect olfactory \\nsystems are combinatorial in nature—instead of activating a single specialized \\nreceptor, each chemical stimulus induces a complex pattern of responses across \\nthe olfactory receptor array. The investigation of OR expression patterns has \\nmade it possible to dissect the major circuits underlying olfaction (Hoare et \\nal. 2011; Imai et al. 2010; Leinwand and Chalasani 2011; Ressler 1994; Ressler \\net al. 1993; Su et al. 2009; Vassar et al. 1993). The evidence obtained \\nconfirmed previous concepts of a common design of mammalian and insect olfactory \\nsystems that are discussed by Hildebrand and coworkers (Hildebrand and Shepherd \\n1997; Hildebrand 2001; Martin et al. 2011). The consequence of the combinatorial \\ndesign of the olfactory system is that the number of unique odor representations \\nis not limited to the number of different receptor types, but can be estimated \\nas mn, where n corresponds to the number of receptor types available and m the \\nnumber of possible response states that each sensor can assume. This is limited \\nto the available signal-to-noise parameters associated with the working system \\n(Cleland and Linster 2005). Vertebrate or invertebrate life surviving in \\ncomplex, changing environments requires the use of sophisticated sensory systems \\nto detect, classify, and interpret patterns of input stimulation. Coding \\nmechanisms by which a certain pattern of stimulations may be described are \\ninherent. Such codes may be defined as sets of symbols that can be used to \\nrepresent patterns of organizations and the sets of rules that govern the \\nselection and use of these symbols. Sensory coding mechanisms in biological \\nsystems would appear to project some representation of sensory inputs as a \\npattern at a high level of the nervous system, the neural activity resulting \\nbeing then related to the previous experience with regard to this pattern or \\nassociated patterns. Fundamental concepts of pattern classification that seem to \\nbe common in biological systems would appear to be template matching, whereby \\nthe pattern to be classified is compared with a set of templates, one for each \\nclass, the closest match determining the classification, and feature detection \\nsystems, in which a number of measurements are taken on the input pattern and \\nthe resulting data are combined to reach a decision. These systems may involve \\neither a sequential approach whereby information from the evaluation of some \\nfeatures is used to decide which features to evaluate next, or a parallel \\napproach where information about all features is evaluated at the same time with \\nno weight being placed on any particular feature. The remarkable capabilities of \\nthe biological chemosensory systems in detection, recognition, and \\ndiscrimination of complex mixtures of chemicals, together with rapid advances in \\nunderstanding how these systems operate, have stimulated the imagination and \\ninterest of many researchers and commercial organizations for the development of \\nelectronic analogs. The dream of emulating biological olfaction using artificial \\ndevices was conceptually realized by Persaud and Dodd (1982), who demonstrated \\nthat an array of electronic chemical sensors with partial specificity could be \\nused to discriminate between simple and complex odors; i.e., the combinatorial \\naspects of olfactory receptors could be emulated, and this could achieve \\nremarkable flexibility in terms of the numbers of types of analytes that can be \\ndiscriminated. This led to a burgeoning of the “electronic nose” field of \\nresearch, and formation of many commercial enterprises interested in exploiting \\na wide range of applications, including environmental, food, medical, security, \\nand others. The researchers and companies have produced instruments that combine \\ngas sensor arrays and pattern analysis techniques for the detection, \\nidentification, or quantification of volatile compounds. The multivariate \\nresponse of an array of chemical gas sensors with broad and partially \\noverlapping selectivities can be processed as a pattern or “fingerprint” to \\ndiscriminate a wide range of odors or volatile compounds using pattern \\nrecognition algorithms. The instruments typically consist of a gas sensor array \\ncomprising many types of sensing technologies, a sample delivery system, and the \\nappropriate electronics for signal processing, data acquisition, and storage. \\nProcessing of data from such systems can be split into four sequential stages: \\nsignal preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, prediction, and validation. The \\nnumbers of sensors incorporated into the devices are relatively small, and the \\ndata handling approaches have been based on traditional chemometric or neural \\nnetwork methods for processing multivariate data. Applications using such \\nchemosensory arrays at present involve issues such as sensor drift, poor \\nsensitivity compared to biological systems, and interference from background \\nodors. With further understanding of biological processes, some of these \\nengineering limitations may be reduced by the adaptation of biologically \\nplausible models for signal processing. This chapter gives an introduction to \\nbiological chemoreception, going on to the field of artificial olfaction, and \\ndiscussing some of the signal processing concepts that may be useful in \\nmimicking biological olfactory systems.'],\n",

Despite various malaria elimination strategies being implemented \\nin the last decades, malaria remains a major public health concern, particularly \\nin tropical and sub-tropical regions. Furthermore, there have been limited and \\ninconclusive studies in Ethiopia to generate information for action towards \\nmalaria in under-five children. Additionally, there is a considerable disparity \\nbetween the results of the existing studies. Therefore, the pooled estimate from \\nthis study will provide a more conclusive result to take evidence-based \\ninterventional measures against under-five malaria.\\nMETHODS: The protocol of this review is registered at PROSPERO with registration \\nnumber CRD42020157886. All appropriate databases and grey literature were \\nsearched to find relevant articles. Studies reporting the prevalence or risk \\nfactors of malaria among under-five children were included. The quality of each \\nstudy was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). \\nData was extracted using Microsoft Excel 2016 and analysis was done using STATA \\n16.0 statistical software.

The last search \\noccurred in October 2018. Other research material was obtained from Google. The \\nfollowing search terms were used, but not limited to: \"African Potato\", \\n\"hypoxis\", \"hemerocallidea\", \"rooperol.\" Articles that were explaining the \\nchemistry and pharmacology of hypoxis hemerocallidea were included.\\nRESULTS: Thirty articles from PubMed, Cochrane and Google Scholar were eligible. \\nThree webpages were included from Google. Results showed that the tuberous \\nrootstock (corm) of African Potato is used traditionally to treat wasting \\ndiseases, testicular tumours, insanity, barrenness, impotency, bad dreams, \\nintestinal parasites, urinary infection, cardiac disease and enhancing immunity. \\nThe plant contains hypoxoside, which is converted rapidly to a potent \\nantioxidant, rooperol in the gut. The corm contains sterols, sterol glycosides, \\nstanols, terpenoids, saponins, cardiac glycosides, tannins and reducing sugars. \\nA dose of 15â€‰mg/kg/day of hypoxoside is reportedly therapeutic. Preclinical \\nstudies of African Potato have shown immunomodulation, antioxidant, \\nantinociceptive, hypoglycaemic, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, \\nantibacterial, uterolytic, antimotility, spasmolytic and anticholinergic \\neffects. The common side effects of African Potato are nausea and vomiting, \\nwhich subside over time. In vitro, African Potato demonstrated inhibitory \\neffects on CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6, 3A4, 3A5, CYP19-metabolism and induction of \\nP-glycoprotein.

These networks are known \\nto be highly modular, with groups of proteins associated with specific \\nbiological functions. Human diseases often arise from the dysfunction of one or \\nmore such proteins of the biological functional group. The ability, to identify \\nand automatically extract these modules has implications for understanding the \\netiology of different diseases as well as the functional roles of different \\nprotein modules in disease. The recent DREAM challenge posed the problem of \\nidentifying disease modules from six heterogeneous networks of proteins/genes. \\nThere exist many community detection algorithms, but all of them are not \\nadaptable to the biological context, as these networks are densely connected and \\nthe size of biologically relevant modules is quite small. The contribution of \\nthis study is 3-fold: first, we present a comprehensive assessment of many \\nclassic community detection algorithms for biological networks to identify \\nnon-overlapping communities, and propose heuristics to identify small and \\nstructurally well-defined communities-core modules. We evaluated our performance \\nover 180 GWAS datasets. In comparison to traditional approaches, with our \\nproposed approach we could identify 50% more number of disease-relevant modules. \\nThus, we show that it is important to identify more compact modules for better \\nperformance. Next, we sought to understand the peculiar characteristics of \\ndisease-enriched modules and what causes standard community detection algorithms \\nto detect so few of them. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the \\ninteraction patterns of known disease genes to understand the structure of \\ndisease modules and show that merely considering the known disease genes set as \\na module does not give good quality clusters, as measured by typical metrics \\nsuch as modularity and conductance. We go on to present a methodology leveraging \\nthese known disease genes, to also include the neighboring nodes of these genes \\ninto a module, to form good quality clusters and subsequently extract a \\n\"gold-standard set\" of disease modules.

Yet, with Church\\'s thesis, and the mechanizability of the \\ndiagonalizations involved, machines can apprehend this and can justify their \\nlimitations, and get some sense of what might be true beyond what they can prove \\nor justify rationally. Indeed, the incompleteness phenomenon introduces a gap \\nbetween what is provable by some machine and what is true about that machine, \\nand, as Gödel saw already in 1931, the existence of that gap is accessible to \\nthe machine itself, once it is has enough provability abilities.

More \\nimportantly incompleteness entails the distinction between many intensional \\nvariants of provability. For example, the absence of reflexion \\n(beweisbar(⌜A⌝)\\xa0→\\xa0A with beweisbar being Gödel\\'s provability predicate) makes it \\nimpossible for the machine\\'s provability to obey the axioms usually taken for a \\ntheory of knowledge. The most important consequence of this in the machine\\'s \\npossible phenomenology is that it provides sense, indeed arithmetical sense, to \\nintensional variants of provability, like the logics of provability-and-truth, \\nwhich at the propositional level can be mirrored by the logic of \\nprovable-and-true statements (beweisbar(⌜A⌝)\\xa0∧\\xa0A). It is incompleteness which \\nmakes this logic different from the logic of provability. Other variants, like \\nprovable-and-consistent, or provable-and-consistent-and-true, appears in the \\nsame way, and inherits the incompleteness splitting, unlike beweisbar(⌜A⌝)\\xa0∧\\xa0A. \\nI will recall thought experience which motivates the use of those intensional \\nvariants to associate a knower and an observer in some canonical way to the \\nmachines or the numbers. We will in this way get an abstract and \\nphenomenological theology of a machine M through the true logics of their true \\nself-referential abilities (even if not provable, or knowable, by the machine \\nitself), in those different intensional senses.

These \\nabnormalities can be remediated for varying periods by therapies that restore \\nnormal brain waves. With many trillions of synapses between billions of neurons \\nin enormously complex circuits needing reinforcement during sleep, the process \\nis susceptible to failures. As a result, some synapses 'normally' weaken or \\nbecome dysfunctional, accumulating to the greatest extent in old memory \\ncircuits. Activation of resulting incompetent circuits during waking may lead to \\nhallucinations and delusions; activation during sleep may lead to dreams with \\nbizarre, incoherent or impossible contents.\"],\n",

The first and most widely investigated of the cannabinoids is \\nΔ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), which is the main psychotropic constituent of \\ncannabis and undergoes significant binding to cannabinoid receptors. These \\ncannabinoid receptors are seven-transmembrane receptors that received their name \\nfrom the fact that they respond to cannabinoid compounds, including Δ9-THC. The \\ncannabinoid receptors have been described in rat, human and mouse brains and \\nthey have been named the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Later, an endogenous \\nmolecule that exerts pharmacological effects similar to those described by \\nΔ9-THC and binds to the cannabinoid receptors was discovered. This molecule, \\nnamed anandamide, was the first of five endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists \\ndescribed to date in the mammalian brain and other tissues. Of these endogenous \\ncannabinoids or endocannabinoids, the most thoroughly investigated to date have \\nbeen anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Over the years, a significant \\nnumber of articles have been published in the field of endogenous cannabinoids, \\nsuggesting a modulatory profile in multiple neurobiological roles of \\nendocannabinoids. The general consensus accepts that the endogenous cannabinoid \\nsystem includes natural ligands (such as anandamide and 2- AG), receptors (CB1 \\nand CB2), and the main enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of anandamide and \\n2-AG (fatty acid amide hydrolase [FAAH] and monoacylglycerol lipase [MAGL], \\nrespectively) as well as the anandamide membrane transporter (AMT). To date, \\ndiverse pieces of evidence have shown that the endocannabinoid system controls \\nmultiple functions such as feeding, pain, learning and memory and has been \\nlinked with various disturbances, such as Parkinson´s disease. Among the \\nmodulatory properties of the endocannabinoid system, current data indicate that \\nthe sleep-wake cycle is under the influence of endocannabinoids since the \\nblocking of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor or the pharmacological inhibition of \\nFAAH activity promotes wakefulness, whereas the obstruction of AMT function \\nenhances sleep.

              " ['It has been claimed that dreams are the royal road to the unconscious mind. The \\npresent work argues that dreams and associated brain states such as memory, \\nattention, flow, and perhaps even consciousness itself arise from diverse \\nconflicts over control of time in the brain. Dreams are the brain\\'s offline \\nefforts to distill projections of the future, while memory represents the \\nvestiges of the past successes and survived failures of those and other \\nconscious projections. Memory thus acts to inform and improve the prediction of \\npossible future states through the use of conscious prospects (planning) and \\nunconscious prospective memory (dreams). When successful, these prospects result \\nin states of flow for conscious planning and déjà vu for its unconscious \\ncomparator. In consequence, and contrary to normal expectation, memory is \\noverwhelmingly oriented to deal with the future. Consciousness is the comparable \\nprocess operating in the present moment. Thus past, present, and future are \\nhomeomorphic with the parts of memory (episodic and autobiographical) that \\nrecall a personal past, consciousness, and the differing dimensions of \\nprospective memory to plan for future circumstances, respectively. Dreaming \\n(i.e., unconscious prospective memory), has the luxury to run multiple \"what if\" \\nsimulations of many possible futures, essentially offline. I explicate these \\npropositions and their relations to allied constructs such as déjà vu and flow. \\nMore generally, I propose that what appear to us as a range of normal \\npsychological experiences are actually manifestations of an ongoing pathological \\nbattle for control within the brain. The landscape of this conflict is time. I \\nsuggest that there are at least 3 general systems bidding for this control, and \\nin the process of evolution, each system has individually conferred a \\nsequentially increasing survival advantage, but only at the expense of a still \\nincomplete functional integration. Through juxtaposition of these respective \\nbrain systems, I endeavor to resolve some fundamental paradoxes and conundrums \\nexpressed in the basic psychological and behavioral processes of sleep, \\nconsciousness, and memory. The implication of this conceptual framework for the \\noverall conception of time is then briefly adumbrated.'],\n",

Thus, dreams have been addressed from a number of \\ndifferent perspectives ranging from philosophy to clinical medicine, as well as \\npsychiatry, psychology, artificial intelligence, neural network models, \\npsychophysiology or neurobiology.\\nDEVELOPMENT: The main models are grounded on the biological function of dreams, \\nespecially those based on processes involving the consolidation of memory and \\nforgetting, and models of simulation. Similarly, current models are developed \\nupon the neurobiology and the neuropsychology of the REM phases of sleep and how \\nthey are differentiated from wakefulness. Thus, neurobiologically speaking, \\ndreams are related to the role of acetylcholine and, neuropsychologically, to \\nthe activation of the limbic and paralimbic regions, the activation of the basal \\nganglia, the activation of cortical areas with a specific modality (especially \\nBrodmann's areas 19, 22 and 37) and the deactivation of the ventromedial, \\nparietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Dreams can be considered a state of consciousness that is \\ncharacterised by a reduced control over their content, visual images and \\nactivation of the memory, and which is mediated by motivational incentives and \\nemotional salience.\"],\n",

Forty-three NT1 patients \\ncompleted a web-survey during Spring 2021 and were compared with 86 \\nmatched-controls. Statistical comparisons revealed that: (a) NT1 patients showed \\ngreater sleepiness than controls; (b) controls showed higher sleep disturbances \\nthan NT1 patients, and this result disappeared when the medication effect in NT1 \\nwas controlled; (c) NT1 patients reported higher lucid dream frequency than \\ncontrols. Focusing on dreaming in NT1 patients, we found that (a) nightmare \\nfrequency was correlated with female gender, longer sleep duration, higher \\nintrasleep wakefulness; (b) dream recall, nightmare and lucid dream frequency \\nwere positively correlated with sleepiness. Comparisons between low and high NT1 \\nlucid dreamers showed that patients more frequently experiencing lucid dreams \\nreported a greater influence of dreaming during wakefulness, especially \\nconcerning problem-solving and creativity. Overall, our results are consistent \\nwith previous studies on pandemic dreaming carried out on healthy subjects. \\nMoreover, we confirmed a link between lucidity and creativity in NT1 patients. \\nConsidering the small sample size and the cross-sectional design, our findings \\ncannot provide a causal relationship between lucid dreams and the COVID-19 \\nlockdown.

Although most cardiovascular \\noutcomes trials continue to use time-to-first event analyses to assess the \\nprimary efficacy end point, such analyses do not adequately reflect the impact \\nof new treatments on the totality of the chronic disease burden. Consequently, \\npatient enrichment and other strategies for ongoing clinical trial design, as \\nwell as new statistical methodologies, are important considerations, \\nparticularly when studying a population with advanced chronic HF. The DREAM-HF \\ntrial (Double-Blind Randomized Assessment of Clinical Events With Allogeneic \\nMesenchymal Precursor Cells in Advanced Heart Failure) is an ongoing, \\nrandomized, sham-controlled phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of \\nmesenchymal precursor cells as immunotherapy in patients with advanced chronic \\nHF with reduced ejection fraction. Mesenchymal precursor cells have a unique \\nmultimodal mechanism of action that is believed to result in polarization of \\nproinflammatory type 1 macrophages in the heart to an anti-inflammatory type 2 \\nmacrophage state, inhibition of maladaptive adverse left ventricular remodeling, \\nreversal of cardiac and peripheral endothelial dysfunction, and recovery of \\nderanged vasculature. The objective of DREAM-HF is to confirm earlier phase 2 \\nresults and evaluate whether mesenchymal precursor cells will reduce the rate of \\nnonfatal recurrent HF-related major adverse cardiac events while delaying or \\npreventing progression of HF to terminal cardiac events. DREAM-HF is an example \\nof an ongoing contemporary events-driven cardiovascular cell-based immunotherapy \\nstudy that has utilized the concepts of baseline disease enrichment, prognostic \\nenrichment, and predictive enrichment to improve its efficiency by using \\naccumulating data from within as well as external to the trial. Adaptive \\nenrichment designs and strategies are important components of a rational \\napproach to achieve clinical research objectives in shorter clinical trial \\ntimelines and with increased cost-effectiveness without compromising ethical \\nstandards or the overall statistical integrity of the study. The DREAM-HF trial \\nalso presents an alternative approach to traditional composite time-to-first \\nevent primary efficacy end points. Statistical methodologies such as the joint \\nfrailty model provide opportunities to expand the scope of events-driven HF with \\nreduced ejection fraction clinical trials to utilize time to recurrent nonfatal \\nHF-related major adverse cardiac events as the primary efficacy end point \\nwithout compromising the integrity of the statistical analyses for terminal \\ncardiac events. In advanced chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction studies, \\nthe joint frailty model is utilized to reflect characteristics of the high-risk \\npatient population with important unmet therapeutic needs. In some cases, use of \\nthe joint frailty model may substantially reduce sample size requirements.

Despite some limitations (e.g., transversal design, large \\nvariation of medications), these preliminary results support the notion that LD \\nis associated with psychosis, but falsify the hypotheses that we set out to \\ntest. A possible explanation is that psychosis enhances the experience of \\ninternal reality in detriment of external reality, and therefore lucid dreamers \\nwith psychotic symptoms would be more able to control their internal reality \\nthan non-psychotic lucid dreamers. Training dream lucidity is likely to produce \\nsafe psychological strengthening in a non-psychotic population, but in a \\npsychotic population LD practice may further empower deliria and hallucinations, \\ngiving internal reality the appearance of external reality.'],\n",

Results. WD patients showed \\na significantly lower dream word count and very few other differences in dream \\ncharacteristics compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Compared to \\nWD patients without RBD, patients with WD and RBD reported significantly higher \\nnightmare frequencies and more dreams with violent or aggressive content \\nretrospectively; their prospectively collected dream reports contained \\nsignificantly more negative emotions and aggression. Conclusions. The reduction \\nin dream length might reflect specific cognitive deficits in WD. The lack of \\ndifferences regarding dream content might be explained by the established \\nsuccessful WD treatment. RBD in WD had a strong impact on dreaming. In \\naccordance with the current definition of RBD, violent, aggressive dream content \\nseems to be a characteristic of RBD also in WD.\"],\n",

Here, we examined cortical activity and \\nfunctional synchronization in frequent nightmare recallers and healthy controls, \\nduring phasic and tonic REM.\\nMETHODS: Frequent nightmare recallers (N\\xa0=\\xa022) and healthy controls (N\\xa0=\\xa022) \\nmatched for high dream recall spent two nights in the laboratory. Phasic and \\ntonic REM periods from the second nights' recordings were selected to examine \\ndifferences in EEG spectral power and weighted phase lag index (WPLI) across \\ngroups and REM states.\\nRESULTS: Phasic REM showed increased power and synchronization in delta and \\ngamma frequency bands, whereas tonic REM featured increased power and \\nsynchronization in the alpha and beta bands. In the theta band, power was higher \\nduring tonic, and synchronization was higher during phasic REM sleep. No \\ndifferences across nightmare and control participants or patterns representing \\ninteractions between the groups and REM microstates emerged.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the idea that abnormal REM sleep power \\nand synchronization play a role in the pathophysiology of frequent nightmares. \\nAltered REM sleep in nightmare disorder could have been confounded with comorbid \\npathologies and increased dream recall, or might be linked to more specific \\nstate factors (nightmare episodes).\"],\n",

As \\neye movements (EMs) are currently considered the best noninvasive indicator of \\nPGO burst activity in humans, the aim of the first experiment was to investigate \\nthe effect of low-intensity repeated auditory stimulation on EMs (and inferred \\nPGO burst activity) during REM sleep. It was predicted that such auditory \\nstimuli during REM sleep would have a suppressive effect on EMs. The aim of the \\nsecond experiment was to examine the effects of this auditory stimulation on \\nsubsequent dream reporting on awakening.\\nDESIGN: Repeated measures design with counterbalanced order of experimental and \\ncontrol conditions across participants.\\nSETTING: Sleep laboratory based polysomnography (PSG) PARTICIPANTS: Experiment 1 \\n: 5 males and 10 females aged 18-35 years (M = 20.8, SD = 5.4).

The neurophysiological \\nand neurohemodynamic brain measures of experimental pain can now largely satisfy \\nthe psychophysiologist's dream, unimaginable only a few years ago, of modelling \\nthe body-brain, brain-mind, mind-matter duality in an inter-linking 3-P triad: \\nphysics (stimulus energy); physiology (brain activities); and psyche \\n(perception). For neuropsychophysiology greater challenges lie ahead: (a) how to \\nintegrate a cohesive theory of human pain in the brain; (b) what levels of \\nanalyses are necessary and sufficient; (c) what constitutes the structural \\norganisation of the pain matrix; (d) what are the modes of processing among and \\nacross the sites of these structures; and (e) how can neural computation of \\nthese processes in the brain be carried out? We may envision that modular \\nidentification and delineation of the arousal-attention, emotion-motivation and \\nperception-cognition neural networks of pain processing in the brain will also \\nlead to deeper understanding of the human mind. Two foreseeable impacts on \\nclinical sciences and basic theories from brain mapping/neuroimaging are the \\nplausible central origin in persistent pain and integration of sensory-motor \\nfunction in pain perception.\"],\n",

This would mean being able to maintain the \\ncapsule steady in a selected area and hold the view in order to have more time \\nto examine the opposite wall of the bowel. In conclusion, future \\ngastroenterologists will have a number of CEs from which to choose, according to \\nthe purpose of the evaluation, whether it be diagnostic and/or therapeutic. Just \\nas the idea of a swallowed capsule taking images as it travels along the human \\nanatomy was once in the realm of sheer fantasy, we have every reason to believe \\nthat the ultimate CE will become a reality in the not far distant future.\"],\n",

The \\nmaximum B1+ bias relative to the true B1+ distribution was 1% for AFI and BS and \\n6% to 15% for DREAM. This caused an average permittivity bias relative to the \\ntrue permittivity of 7% to 20% for AFI and BS and 12% to 35% for DREAM. \\nPrecision was assessed in MR experiments.

Default mode network (DMN) activity increases \\nduring rest and reduces during various tasks including visual perception. The \\nimplicit anticorrelation between the DMN and task-positive network (TPN)-that \\npersists in REM sleep-prompted us to focus on DMN responses to \\ntemporally-precise REM events.

Furthermore, our analysis revealed \\na modest temporally-precise REM-locked decrease-phasic deactivation-in key DMN \\nnodes, in a subset of independent studies. These results are consistent with \\nhierarchical predictive coding; namely, permissive deactivation of DMN at the \\ntop of the hierarchy (leading to the widespread cortical activation at lower \\nlevels; especially the primary visual cortex).

              " ['Functional brain imaging has been used in humans to noninvasively investigate \\nthe neural mechanisms underlying the generation of sleep stages. On the one \\nhand, REM sleep has been associated with the activation of the pons, thalamus, \\nlimbic areas, and temporo-occipital cortices, and the deactivation of prefrontal \\nareas, in line with theories of REM sleep generation and dreaming properties. On \\nthe other hand, during non-REM (NREM) sleep, decreases in brain activity have \\nbeen consistently found in the brainstem, thalamus, and in several cortical \\nareas including the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), in agreement with a \\nhomeostatic need for brain energy recovery. Benefiting from a better temporal \\nresolution, more recent studies have characterized the brain activations related \\nto phasic events within specific sleep stages. In particular, they have \\ndemonstrated that NREM sleep oscillations (spindles and slow waves) are indeed \\nassociated with increases in brain activity in specific subcortical and cortical \\nareas involved in the generation or modulation of these waves. These data \\nhighlight that, even during NREM sleep, brain activity is increased, yet \\nregionally specific and transient. Besides refining the understanding of sleep \\nmechanisms, functional brain imaging has also advanced the description of the \\nfunctional properties of sleep. For instance, it has been shown that the \\nsleeping brain is still able to process external information and even detect the \\npertinence of its content.

Meanwhile, coronary \\nstent implantation is a standard procedure in interventional cardiology. From \\nthe beginning of permanent stent implantation, research started to provide \\ntemporary stenting of coronary arteries, first with catheter-based systems, \\nlater with stent-alone technology. Stents were produced from polymers or metal. \\nThe first polymer stent implantation failed except the Igaki-Tamai stent in \\nJapan. Newly developed absorbable polymer stents seem to be very promising, as \\nintravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography have \\ndemonstrated. Temporary metal stents were developed based on iron and magnesium. \\nCurrently, the iron stent is tested in peripheral arteries. The absorbable \\nmagnesium stent (Biotronik, Berlin, Germany) was tested in peripheral arteries \\nbelow the knee and meanwhile in the multicenter international PROGRESS-AMS \\n(Clinical Performance and Angiographic Results of Coronary Stenting with \\nAbsorbable Metal Stents) study. The first magnesium stent implantation was \\nperformed on July 30, 2004 after extended experimental testing in Essen. The \\nmagnesium stent behaved like a bare-metal stent with low recoil of 5-7%. The \\nstent struts were absorbed when tested with IVUS. Stent struts were not visible \\nby fluoroscopy or computed tomography (CT) as well as magnetic resonance imaging \\n(MRI). That means, that the magnesium stent is invisible and therefore CT and \\nMRI can be used for imaging of interventions. Only using micro-CT the stent \\nstruts were visible. The absorption process could be demonstrated in a patient \\n18 days after implantation due to suspected acute coronary syndrome, which was \\nexcluded. IVUS showed a nice open lumen. Stent struts were no longer visible, \\nbut replaced by tissue indicating the previous stent location. Coronary \\nangiography after 4 months showed an ischemia-driven target lesion \\nrevascularization rate of 23.8% which was below the 30% cut point of the study \\nprotocol. No myocardial Q wave infarction or death were reported. The primary \\nendpoint was reached. During the follow-up period, vasomotion was tested in some \\nof the patients. The proof of principle was confirmed: restoration of vasomotion \\nduring acetylcholine testing. The development of the absorbable magnesium stent, \\nwhich was pushed forward by B.

              "  \"BACKGROUND: CD38, a druggable ectoenzyme, is involved in the generation of \\nadenosine, which is implicated in tumour immune evasion. Its expression and role \\nin prostate tumour-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) have not been elucidated.\\nOBJECTIVE: To characterise CD38 expression on prostate cancer (PC) epithelial \\ncells and TIICs, and to associate this expression with clinical outcomes.\\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: RNAseq from 159 patients with metastatic \\ncastration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the International Stand Up To \\nCancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation (SU2C/PCF) cohort and 171 mCRPC samples taken \\nfrom 63 patients in the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre cohort were \\nanalysed. CD38 expression was immunohistochemically scored by a validated assay \\non 51 castration-resistant PC (CRPC) and matching, same-patient \\ncastration-sensitive PC (CSPC) biopsies obtained between 2016 and 2018, and was \\nassociated with retrospectively collected clinical data. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS \\nAND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: mCRPC transcriptomes were analysed for associations \\nbetween CD38 expression and gene expression signatures. Multiplex \\nimmunofluorescence determined CD38 expression in PC biopsies. Differences in \\nCD38+ TIIC densities between CSPC and CRPC biopsies were analysed using a \\nnegative binomial mixed model. Differences in the proportions of CD38+ \\nepithelial cells between non-matched benign prostatic epithelium and PC were \\ncompared using Fisher's exact test. Differences in the proportions of biopsies \\ncontaining CD38+ tumour epithelial cells between matched CSPC and CRPC biopsies \\nwere compared by McNemar's test. Univariable and multivariable survival analyses \\nwere performed using Cox regression models.\\nRESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: CD38 mRNA expression in mCRPC was most significantly \\nassociated with upregulated immune signalling pathways. CD38 mRNA expression was \\nassociated with interleukin (IL)-12, IL-23, and IL-27 signalling signatures as \\nwell as immunosuppressive adenosine signalling and T cell exhaustion signatures. \\nCD38 protein was frequently expressed on phenotypically diverse TIICs including \\nB cells and myeloid cells, but largely absent from tumour epithelial cells. \\nCD38+ TIIC density increased with progression to CRPC and was independently \\nassociated with worse overall survival. Future studies are required to dissect \\nTIIC CD38 function.\\nCONCLUSIONS: CD38+ prostate TIICs associate with worse survival and \\nimmunosuppressive mechanisms. The role of CD38 in PC progression warrants \\ninvestigation as insights into its functions may provide rationale for CD38 \\ntargeting in lethal PC.\\nPATIENT SUMMARY: CD38 is expressed on the surface of white blood cells \\nsurrounding PC cells. These cells may impact PC growth and treatment resistance. \\nPatients with PC with more CD38-expressing white blood cells are more likely to \\ndie earlier.\"],\n",

Vera \\nBuhrmann prosiguió su interés en las tradiciones de Curación Africanas de un \\nmodo profundamente respetuoso, pero un interés recíproco estuvo ausente. Cuando \\nPeter se encontró con Nomfundo Mlisa, psicóloga clínica y curadora tradicional \\ncon un agudo interés en Jung, comenzó un proyecto de verdadero diálogo entre \\nAnalistas Junguianos y Curadores Tradicionales de África. Hogsback fragmento de \\nvideo: Los temas fueron Umbilini/Intuición, y Sueños desde las perspectivas de \\nÁfrica y Occidente. Descripciones dadas por THP y analistas Junguianos, \\ndelinearon similitudes y diferencias. Se describió un caso en el cual los \\nefectos disociativos internos del colonialismo fueron claramente demostrados. Se \\ncompartió un sueño y se ofrecieron interpretaciones de África y Occidente. Parte \\n2: El contexto: Fred Borchardt Se subrayan dos contextos: 1) El movimiento \\nsocial activista RhodesMustFall, iniciado el 9 de Marzo de 2015. Las protestas \\nse focalizaron en la represión de los sistemas de pensamiento indígena por parte \\ndel colonialismo. Nuestro proyecto debía tomar en cuenta como la colonización ha \\nimpactado en los Sistemas de Curación Indígenas. Nuestro instrumento en este \\ntrabajo es la psicología analítica de Jung, la cual ofrece una base para \\ncomenzar un diálogo con otras culturas. 2) El discurso en círculos Junguianos \\nsobre el pedido de perdón a las personas de descendencia Africana por la forma \\nen la cual son descriptos en la literatura Junguiana. Monkey Valley: fragmento \\nde video: Ester Haumann, analista Junguiana, al reflexionar sobre el trauma de \\nla Guerra Boer en sus ancestros inmediatos, plantea la provocativa pregunta: \\n¿cómo es que sucede que el oprimido deviene en opresor? Emerge cuando el trauma \\nno es procesado, y se repite. Vella Maseko, Curadora Tradicional Africana y \\npsicóloga clínica responde con preocupación sobre el dolor de la nación en Sud \\nÁfrica, y cómo nosotros como curadores respondemos a esto. Parte 3: La posición \\ny la cosmovisión del médico tradicional de la salud: Nomfundo Mlisa Analistas \\nJunguianos y Curadores Tradicionales han iniciado diálogos críticos basados en \\ndiversas críticas políticas así como en impedimentos históricos que impactaron \\nnegativamente en los sistemas tradicionales de salud. Se destacan los lazos \\nentre la teoría Junguiana y las de curación tradicional. Se expresa un llamado a \\nla introspección a través de la teoría de Johari Window para posibilitar \\nencuentros entre unos y otros, dentro nuestro y entre nosotros. Se acuñó la \\nnecesidad de una terapia del arcoíris, haciendo de los analistas Junguianos Sud \\nAfricanos, y de los curadores tradicionales, los pioneros en iniciar una terapia \\ndel arco iris.

En la segunda conferencia, un abordaje \\nnarrativo fue propuesto, el cual funcionó muy bien. Ambos lados pudieron \\ndescribir sus caminos para llegar a ser curadores, y las similitudes fueron \\nllamativas. El efecto curador de encontrar un fundamento común a través de una \\nrespetuosa receptividad mutua fue profundo.

Thus, we sought to identify the intrinsic molecular subtypes of mCRPC \\nand assess molecular and clinical correlates in the largest combined cohort of \\nmCRPC samples with gene expression data available to date.\\nMETHODS: We combined and batch effect corrected gene expression data from four \\nmCRPC cohorts from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC, N=157), a \\nsmall-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (SCNC)-enriched cohort from Weill \\nCornell Medicine (WCM, N=49), and cohorts from the Stand Up 2 Cancer/Prostate \\nCancer Foundation East Coast Dream Team (ECDT, N=266) and the West Coast Dream \\nTeam (WCDT, N=162).\\nRESULTS: Hierarchical clustering of RNA-seq data from these 634 mCRPC samples \\nidentified two distinct adenocarcinoma subtypes, one of which (adeno-immune) was \\ncharacterized by higher gene expression of immune pathways, higher CIBERSORTx \\nimmune scores, diminished ASI benefit, and non-lymph node metastasis tropism \\ncompared to an adeno-classic subtype. We also identified two distinct subtypes \\nwith enrichment for a neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype, including an NE-liver \\nsubgroup characterized by liver metastasis tropism, PTEN loss, and APC and SPOP \\nmutations compared to an NE-classic subgroup.\\nCONCLUSION: Our results emphasize the heterogeneity of mCRPC beyond currently \\naccepted molecular phenotypes, and suggests that future studies should consider \\nincorporating transcriptome-wide profiling in order to better understand how \\nthese differences impact treatment responses and outcomes.'],\n",

However, acquisition of contemporary tissue samples for molecular \\ntesting can be a barrier to deploying precision medicine approaches. We \\nhypothesized that most DDR alterations represent truncal events in prostate \\ncancer and that primary tissue would faithfully reflect mutations found in \\ncell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and/or metastatic tissue.\\nOBJECTIVE: To assess concordance in DDR gene alterations between primary \\nprostate cancer and metastases or ctDNA specimens.\\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients were included if a DDR pathway \\nmutation was detected in metastatic tissue or ctDNA and primary tissue \\nsequencing was available for comparison. Sequencing data from 3 cohorts were \\nanalyzed: (1) FoundationOne, (2) University of Washington clinical cases \\n(University of Washington-OncoPlex or Stand Up to Cancer-Prostate Cancer \\nFoundation International Dream Team sequencing pipelines), and (3) University of \\nWashington rapid autopsy series. Only pathogenic somatic mutations were \\nincluded, and more than 30 days between primary tumor tissue and ctDNA and/or \\nmetastatic tissue acquisition was required. Clonal hematopoiesis of \\nindeterminate potential (CHIP) and germline events were adjudicated by an expert \\nmolecular pathologist and excluded.\\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The DDR gene alterations detected in primary \\nprostate tissue matched with metastatic tissue and/or ctDNA findings.\\nRESULTS: A total of 72 men with known DDR alterations were included in the \\nanalysis, and primary samples with paired ctDNA and/or metastatic tissue were \\nsequenced. After excluding patients with ctDNA where only CHIP and/or germline \\nevents (n\\u2009=\\u200921) were observed, 51 patients remained and were included in the \\nfinal analysis. The median (range) time from acquisition of primary tissue to \\nacquisition of ctDNA or tumor tissue was 55 (5-193) months. Concordance in DDR \\ngene mutation status across samples was 84% (95% CI, 71%-92%). Rates of \\nconcordance between metastatic-primary and ctDNA-primary pairs were similar when \\npatients with CHIP events were excluded. Multiclonal BRCA2 reversion mutations \\nassociated with resistance to PARP inhibitors and platinum chemotherapy were \\ndetected in ctDNA from 2 patients.\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this genetic association study of 3 patient \\ncohorts, primary prostate tissue accurately reflected the mutational status of \\nactionable DDR genes in metastatic tissue, consistent with DDR alterations being \\ntruncal in most patients. After excluding likely CHIP events, ctDNA profiling \\naccurately captured these DDR mutations while also detecting reversion \\nalterations that may suggest resistance mechanisms.',\n",

In this case study, we examined the language fellows used in response \\nto this encouragement, hypothesizing that they would engage in a variety of \\npandemic-related instructor talk, i.e., language that instructors use in the \\nclassroom that is not directly tied to educational content. We analyzed \\ntranscripts from 17 2-hour undergraduate biology seminar courses and found 167 \\ninstances of pandemic-related instructor talk. We used grounded theory to \\nidentify categories that emerged from these quotations: Positive coping \\nmechanisms and self-care; Adjusting to online learning; Compassionate \\ninstruction; Personal impacts; COVID-19 and society; Dreaming; and Biology of \\nCOVID-19.

              " [\"OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of an advanced cancer in young adulthood can bring \\none's life to an abrupt halt, calling attention to the present moment and \\ncreating anguish about an uncertain future. There is seldom time or physical \\nstamina to focus on forward-thinking, social roles, relationships, or dreams. As \\na result, young adults (YAs) with advanced cancer frequently encounter \\nexistential distress, despair, and question the purpose of their life. We sought \\nto investigate the meaning and function of hope throughout YAs' disease \\ntrajectory; to discern the psychosocial processes YAs employ to engage hope; and \\nto develop a substantive theory of hope of YAs diagnosed with advanced cancer.\\nMETHOD: Thirteen YAs (ages 23-38) diagnosed with a stage III or IV cancer were \\nrecruited throughout the eastern and southeastern United States. Participants \\ncompleted one semi-structured interview in-person, by phone, or Skype, that \\nincorporated an original timeline instrument assessing fluctuations in hope and \\nan online socio-demographic survey. Glaser's grounded theory methodology \\ninformed constant comparative methods of data collection, analysis, and \\ninterpretation.\\nRESULTS: Findings from this study informed the development of the novel \\ncontingent hope theoretical framework, which describes the pattern of \\npsychosocial behaviors YAs with advanced cancer employ to reconcile identities \\nand strive for a life of meaning. The ability to cultivate the necessary agency \\nand pathways to reconcile identities became contingent on the YAs' participation \\nin each of the psychosocial processes of the contingent hope theoretical \\nframework: navigating uncertainty, feeling broken, disorienting grief, finding \\nbearings, and identity reconciliation.\\nSIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Study findings portray the influential role of hope in \\nmotivating YAs with advanced cancer through disorienting grief toward an \\nintegrated sense of self that marries cherished aspects of multiple identities. \\nThe contingent hope theoretical framework details psychosocial behaviors to \\ninform assessments and interventions fostering hope and identity reconciliation.\"],\n",

Strong arguments in favour of conducting clinical tolerance \\ntrials are the high number of grafts still lost due to chronic rejection, the \\nburden of serious adverse effects from immunosuppressants which causes \\nconsiderable cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, respectively, and the fact \\nthat sporadic tolerance can be observed in rare cases where non-adherence to \\nimmunosuppressive regimens is linked with a state of long-lasting organ \\ntolerance. Whereas molecule-based regimens have been largely ineffective, \\ncell-based tolerance protocols have delivered some encouraging results to \\nachieve COT.\\nDISCUSSION: In combination with donor bone marrow-derived stem cells, some \\nencouraging results in COT development were reported lately for renal \\ntransplantation as well. However, less toxic conditioning protocols and more \\nexperience by use of cell products with regulatory properties in combination \\nwith synergizing immunosuppressive drugs is required to launch future tolerance \\ntrials for a broader spectrum of potential transplant candidates. New methods in \\nimmunomonitoring including biomarkers, microarray-based genetic tolerance \\nsignatures and functional assays may pave the way to achieve COT in upcoming \\nclinical trials.'],\n",

Epigenetic studies were \\ncarried out in a rapid autopsy cohort.\\nRESULTS: Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) expression is increased in DNPC relative to \\nprostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing mCRPC in the Stand Up to \\nCancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation discovery cohort (11.2 v 0.28 reads per \\nkilobase per million mapped reads; q &lt; 0.05; n = 117) and in the University of \\nWashington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center cohort (9.2 v 0.99 fragments \\nper kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads; P &lt; .0001). DKK1 expression \\ncan be regulated by activated Wnt signaling in vitro and correlates with \\nactivating canonical Wnt signaling mutations and low PSA mRNA in mCRPC biopsies \\n(P &lt; .05). DKK1 hypomethylation was associated with increased DKK1 mRNA \\nexpression (Pearson r = -0.66; P &lt; .0001) in a rapid autopsy cohort (n = 7). \\nDKK1-high mCRPC biopsies are infiltrated with significantly higher numbers of \\nquiescent natural killer (NK) cells (P &lt; .005) and lower numbers of activated NK \\ncells (P &lt; .0005).

              " [\"The ultimate aim of health care policy is good care at good prices. Managed care \\nfailed to achieve this goal through influencing providers, so health policy has \\nturned to the only market-based option left: treating patients like consumers. \\nHealth insurance and tax policy now pressure patients to spend their own money \\nwhen they select health plans, providers, and treatments. Expecting patients to \\nchoose what they need at the price they want, consumerists believe that market \\ncompetition will constrain costs while optimizing quality. This classic form of \\nconsumerism is today's health policy watchword. This article evaluates \\nconsumerism and the regulatory mechanism of which it is essentially an example - \\nlegally mandated disclosure of information. We do so by assessing the crucial \\nassumptions about human nature on which consumerism and mandated disclosure \\ndepend. Consumerism operates in a variety of contexts in a variety of ways with \\na variety of aims. To assess so protean a thing, we ask what a patient's life \\nwould really be like in a consumerist world. The literature abounds in theories \\nabout how medical consumers should behave. We look for empirical evidence about \\nhow real people actually buy health plans, choose providers, and select \\ntreatments. We conclude that consumerism is unlikely to accomplish its goals. \\nConsumerism's prerequisites are too many and too demanding. First, consumers \\nmust have choices that include the coverage, care-takers, and care they want. \\nSecond, reliable information about those choices must be available. Third, \\ninformation must be put before consumers in helpful ways, especially by doctors. \\nFourth, the information must be complete and comprehensible enough for consumers \\nto use it. Fifth, consumers must understand what they are told. Sixth, consumers \\nmust actually analyze the information and do so well enough to make good \\nchoices. Our review of the empirical evidence concludes that these \\npre-requisites cannot be met reliably most of the time. At every stage people \\nencounter daunting hurdles. Like so many other dreams of controlling costs and \\ngiving patients control, consumerism is doomed to disappoint. This does not mean \\nthat consumerist tools should never be used. If all that consumerism \\naccomplished is to raise general cost-consciousness among patients, still, it \\ncould make a substantial contribution to the larger cost-control efforts by \\ninsurers and the government. Once patients bear responsibility for much \\nday-to-day spending on their health needs, they should be increasingly \\nsensitized to the difficult trade-offs that abound in medical care and might \\neven begin to understand that public and private health insurers have a \\nlegitimate interest in controlling medical spending.\"],\n",
              " ['Although the role of the Hippo signaling pathway in development and \\ntumorigenesis has been extensively studied in multiple organs, its role in \\novarian follicle development remains largely unknown. Here, we report that \\nYes-Associated Protein 1 (YAP1), the major effector of Hippo signaling, is \\nspatiotemporally expressed in ovarian granulosa cells and plays a critical role \\nin the regulation of follicle development. We found that the active form of YAP1 \\n(nuclear YAP1) was predominantly expressed in proliferative granulosa cells, \\nwhereas the inactive form of YAP1 (cytoplasmic YAP1) was mainly detected in \\nluteal cells (terminally differentiated granulosa cells). Pharmacological \\ninhibition of YAP1 activity disrupted mouse ovarian follicle development in \\nvitro and in vivo. Foxl2 promoter-driven knockout of Yap1 in ovarian granulosa \\ncells resulted in increased apoptosis of granulosa cells, decreased number of \\ncorpora lutea, reduced ovarian size, and subfertility in transgenic mice. \\nHowever, Cyp19a1 promoter-driven knockout of Yap1 in differentiated granulosa \\ncells of preovulatory follicles and luteal cells of corpora lutea had no effect \\non ovarian morphology and fertility. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that YAP1 \\ninteracted with epidermal growth factor receptor and TGF-β signaling pathways to \\nregulate granulosa cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Results \\nfrom this study identify YAP1 as a critical regulator of granulosa cell \\nproliferation and differentiation. Balanced expression and activation of YAP1 is \\nessential for follicle development and successful reproduction. YAP1 is a \\npromising target for treatment of subfertility associated with abnormal \\ngranulosa cell function.-Lv, X., He, C., Huang, C., Wang, H., Hua, G., Wang, Z., \\nZhou, J., Chen, X., Ma, B., Timm, B.

AGYW, who used daily oral TDF/FTC, completed \\ninterviews and provided dried blood spots (DBS) for measurement of \\ntenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations at enrollment and 3 months later, \\nand 176/302 (58.3%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI 52.3 to 63.8]) met our \\ndefinition of PrEP persistence: having expressed intention to use PrEP and \\nattended both the second interview and an interim refill visit.

Jung's method was in \\nopposition to Freud's psychoanalysis.

For each core quality I describe short \\ndreamwork sequences from my own practice and a schematic image of how I perceive \\nthe overriding interaction between systems in the dreaming brain. For each core \\nquality recommendations for practical dreamwork are provided. Finally, I draw \\nattention to dreams as a huge psychological resource for humankind.\",\n",

When REMs accompanied goal-oriented motor behaviour during RBD (e.g., \\nframing something, greeting with the hand, climbing a ladder), 90% were directed \\ntowards the action of the patient (same plane and direction). REMs were however \\nabsent in 38% of goal-oriented behaviours. This directional coherence between \\nlimbs, head and eye movements during RBD suggests that, when present, REMs \\nimitate the scanning of the dream scene. Because REMs index and complexity were \\nsimilar in patients with RBD and controls, this concordance can be extended to \\nnormal REM sleep.

If this view is correct, \\nit renders REMs an ideal probe to study consciousness as \"an exclusively \\ninternal affair\" (Metzinger, 2009). In other words, REMs offer a probe of active \\ninference - in the sense of predictive coding - when the brain is isolated from \\nthe sensorium in virtue of the natural blockade of sensory afferents during REM \\nsleep. Crucially, REMs are temporally precise events that enable powerful \\ninferences based on time series analyses.

Besides inducing behavioral unresponsiveness, a key goal of \\nanesthesia is to prevent the experience of surgery (connected consciousness), by \\ninducing either unconsciousness or disconnection of consciousness from the \\nenvironment. Review of the isolated forearm technique demonstrates that \\nconsciousness, connectedness, and responsiveness uncouple during anesthesia; in \\nclinical conditions, a median 37% of patients demonstrate connected \\nconsciousness. We describe potential neurobiological constructs that can explain \\nthis phenomenon: during light anesthesia the subcortical mechanisms subserving \\nspontaneous behavioral responsiveness are disabled but information integration \\nwithin the corticothalamic network continues to produce consciousness, and \\nunperturbed norepinephrinergic signaling maintains connectedness. These concepts \\nemphasize the need for developing anesthetic regimens and depth of anesthesia \\nmonitors that specifically target mechanisms of consciousness, connectedness, \\nand responsiveness.'],\n",

With our \\nrecent understanding of hallucinations in different population groups and at the \\nneurobiological, cognitive and interpersonal levels, it is now possible to draw \\ncomparisons between the 2 sets of experiences as never before. In the current \\narticle, we make detailed comparisons between sleep-related experiences and \\nhallucinations in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eye disease, at the \\nlevels of phenomenology (content, sensory modalities involved, perceptual \\nattributes) and of brain function (brain activations, resting-state networks, \\nneurotransmitter action). Findings show that sleep-related experiences share \\nconsiderable overlap with hallucinations at the level of subjective descriptions \\nand underlying brain mechanisms. Key differences remain however: (1) \\nSleep-related perceptions are immersive and largely cut off from reality, \\nwhereas hallucinations are discrete and overlaid on veridical perceptions; and \\n(2) Sleep-related perceptions involve only a subset of neural networks \\nimplicated in hallucinations, reflecting perceptual signals processed in a \\nfunctionally and cognitively closed-loop circuit. In summary, both phenomena are \\nnon-veridical perceptions that share some phenomenological and neural \\nsimilarities, but insufficient evidence exists to fully support the notion that \\nthe majority of hallucinations depend on REM processes or REM intrusions into \\nwaking consciousness.\"],\n",

It should be mentioned that some evidence from \\nchildhood investigations, albeit still weak and contrasting, revealed a certain \\ncorrelation between cognitive skills and specific features of dream reports. In \\nthis respect, infantile amnesia, confabulatory reports, dream-reality \\ndiscerning, and limitation in language production and emotional comprehension \\nshould be considered as important confounding factors. Differently, growing \\nevidence in adults suggests that the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying \\nthe encoding and retrieval of episodic memories may remain the same across \\ndifferent states of consciousness. More directly, some studies on adults point \\nto shared neural mechanisms between waking cognition and corresponding dream \\nfeatures. A general decline in the dream recall frequency is commonly reported \\nin the elderly, and it is explained in terms of a diminished interest in \\ndreaming and in its emotional salience.

Careful work must be done by modern \\ninvestigators before the field of medical psychoanalysis can address the basic \\nquestions of mind-body functioning that are at issue here.

              " [\"A common observation in EEG research is that consciousness vanishes with the \\nappearance of delta (1-4\\u2009Hz) waves, particularly when those waves are high \\namplitude. High amplitude delta oscillations are frequently observed in states \\nof diminished consciousness, including slow wave sleep, anaesthesia, generalized \\nepileptic seizures, and disorders of consciousness, such as coma and the \\nvegetative state. This strong correlation between loss of consciousness and high \\namplitude delta oscillations is thought to stem from the widespread cortical \\ndeactivation that occurs during the 'down states' or troughs of these slow \\noscillations. Recently, however, many studies have reported the presence of \\nprominent delta activity during conscious states, which casts doubt on the \\nhypothesis that high amplitude delta oscillations are an indicator of \\nunconsciousness. These studies include work in Angelman syndrome, epilepsy, \\nbehavioural responsiveness during propofol anaesthesia, postoperative delirium, \\nand states of dissociation from the environment such as dreaming and powerful \\npsychedelic states. The foregoing studies complement an older, yet largely \\nunacknowledged, body of literature that has documented awake, conscious patients \\nwith high amplitude delta oscillations in clinical reports from Rett syndrome, \\nLennox-Gastaut syndrome, schizophrenia, mitochondrial diseases, hepatic \\nencephalopathy, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. At the same time, a \\nlargely parallel body of recent work has reported convincing evidence that the \\ncomplexity or entropy of EEG and magnetoencephalographic signals strongly \\nrelates to an individual's level of consciousness.

Firstly, \\nconscious perception of external events is intricately linked with the formation \\nof episodic (declarative) memories, a key function attributed to the \\nhippocampus. Secondly, conscious experience is allocentric and contextualized. \\nConsciousness creates or simulates an image of the world that appears to \\nsurround us and to be independent of our observation of it.

Among the \\nmodulatory properties of the endocannabinoid system, current data indicate that \\nthe sleep-wake cycle is under the influence of endocannabinoids since the \\nblocking of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor or the pharmacological inhibition of \\nFAAH activity promotes wakefulness, whereas the obstruction of AMT function \\nenhances sleep. However, no solid evidence is available regarding the role of \\nthe endocannabinoid system in an unquestionable emotional component of the \\nsleep: Dream activity. Since dreaming is a mental activity that occurs during \\nsleep (characterized by emotions, sensory perceptions, and bizarre components) \\nand the endocannabinoid system modulates neurobiological processes involving \\nconsciousness, such as learning and memory, attention, pain perception, emotions \\nand sleep, it is acceptable to hypothesize that the endocannabinoid system might \\nbe modulating dream activity. In this regard, an accumulative body of evidence \\nin human and animal models has been reported regarding the role of the \\nendocannabinoid system in the control of emotional states and dreams. Moreover, \\npreliminary studies in humans have indicated that treatment with cannabinoids \\nmay decrease post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, including nightmares.\\nCONCLUSION: Thus, based on a review of the literature available in PubMed, this \\narticle hypothesizes a conceptual framework within which the endocannabinoid \\nsystem might influence the generation of dream experiences.'],\n",

This \"mind \\nwandering\" function, implicated in dreaming, fantasy processing, remembering and \\nthinking, is the essence of the imaginative function and constitutes the first \\nform of reflection, where intentions and drives gain a primordial form of \\nconscious (but not self-conscious) representation. During postnatal development, \\nthis original (\"archetypal\") imaginative function is slowly attuned in a \\nrelational \"transitional\" space and may be expressed first in non-verbal and \\neventually in abstract-verbal social communicative patterns. Our view has \\nnoticeable implications for psychotherapy. Instead of trying to directly modify \\ninterpersonal, extrinsic relationships (a top-down approach), dysfunctional \\nemotional-relational patterns may be modified by a process in which the patient \\nis helped to let-go of the perceived feeling-objects in favor of an immersion, \\nvia the actual feeling, from the superficial level of perception towards a void \\nfeeling-state, empty of images. Only starting from this \"anoetic\" feeling-state, \\nthe deep imaginal creative and re-structuring self-referential activity may be \\nreactivated by a process of spontaneous imagination.'],\n",

Currently neuropsychoanalysis constituted itself as a discipline \\ncontained in itself three separate areas: the psychodynamic neuroscience, \\nclinical neuropsychoanalysis and theory building. The article introduces the \\ntheory of Jaak Panksepp emotional systems as an example of anintegrated \\nneurobiology of affect, behavioral biology, evolutionary psychology and \\npsychoanalysis. The theory of emotional systems includes the description of the \\nSEEKING system representing basic motivational system of the organism. Apart \\nfrom a new perspective on the theory of drives described by Sigmund Freud, it \\noffers the possibility to take into account the emotional and motivational \\nsystems within the understanding of mental disorders such as depression, \\naddiction and psychosis, which is the core of psychoanalytic thinking.'],\n",
              " [\"A common observation in EEG research is that consciousness vanishes with the \\nappearance of delta (1-4\\u2009Hz) waves, particularly when those waves are high \\namplitude. High amplitude delta oscillations are frequently observed in states \\nof diminished consciousness, including slow wave sleep, anaesthesia, generalized \\nepileptic seizures, and disorders of consciousness, such as coma and the \\nvegetative state. This strong correlation between loss of consciousness and high \\namplitude delta oscillations is thought to stem from the widespread cortical \\ndeactivation that occurs during the 'down states' or troughs of these slow \\noscillations. Recently, however, many studies have reported the presence of \\nprominent delta activity during conscious states, which casts doubt on the \\nhypothesis that high amplitude delta oscillations are an indicator of \\nunconsciousness. These studies include work in Angelman syndrome, epilepsy, \\nbehavioural responsiveness during propofol anaesthesia, postoperative delirium, \\nand states of dissociation from the environment such as dreaming and powerful \\npsychedelic states. The foregoing studies complement an older, yet largely \\nunacknowledged, body of literature that has documented awake, conscious patients \\nwith high amplitude delta oscillations in clinical reports from Rett syndrome, \\nLennox-Gastaut syndrome, schizophrenia, mitochondrial diseases, hepatic \\nencephalopathy, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. At the same time, a \\nlargely parallel body of recent work has reported convincing evidence that the \\ncomplexity or entropy of EEG and magnetoencephalographic signals strongly \\nrelates to an individual's level of consciousness. Having reviewed this \\nliterature, we discuss plausible mechanisms that would resolve the seeming \\ncontradiction between high amplitude delta oscillations and consciousness. We \\nalso consider implications concerning theories of consciousness, such as \\nintegrated information theory and the entropic brain hypothesis. Finally, we \\nconclude that false inferences of unconscious states can be best avoided by \\nexamining measures of electrophysiological complexity in addition to spectral \\npower.\"],\n",

While \\ndreams' meaning and implications have remained controversial, not disputed is \\nthe occurrence of drinking/drug-using dreams (DDUD) when people enter recovery \\nfrom a significant alcohol and other drug (AOD) problem. Typically taking the \\nform of a relapse scenario followed by relief on awakening, such dreams can be \\nprofoundly unnerving. Beyond common anecdotal reports of these phenomena, \\nhowever, very little is known about the prevalence, predictors, and decay of \\nsuch dreams with time in recovery. Greater knowledge could help inform patients \\nand providers about what to anticipate in recovery.\\nMETHOD: Nationally-representative cross-sectional study of US adults \\n(N\\u202f=\\u202f39,093) who had resolved a significant AOD problem (weighted n\\u202f=\\u202f2002).\\nMEASURES: DDUD prevalence/time since last DDUD; demographics; measures of \\nclinical history.\\nRESULTS: Approximately one third (31.9%) reported experiencing DDUD which were \\npredicted by more severe clinical history variables (earlier age of onset; prior \\ntreatment/mutual-help participation). A significant linear decay of DDUD \\noccurrence was observed with time in recovery.\\nCONCLUSIONS: DDUD appear to occur among a substantial minority of US adults \\nresolving significant AOD problems and are related to a more pronounced and \\ndeleterious AOD history. DDUD attenuate in frequency over time in recovery which \\nplausibly may be indicative of increased biopsychosocial stability that reduces \\nneurocognitive reverberation and psychological angst regarding relapse risk. \\nFurther prospective research is needed to understand the frequency, topography, \\ncontent variability, and influence such dreams may have on intermediate (e.g., \\nabstinence self-efficacy) and ultimate (substance use) outcomes.\"],\n",

In this article, the author suggests to address this question with \\na notable scientific and cultural openness that embraces either the \\npsychoanalytic approach (classical, modern and intersubjective), and the \\nneurophysiological assumptions and both clinical research and cognitive \\nhypotheses. The utility of dream - in the clinical work with patients - is \\nsupported by the author with extensive bibliographic references and personal \\nclinical insights, drawn from his experience as a psychotherapist. Results: From \\nan analysis of recent literature on this topic, the dream assumes a very \\ndifferent function and position in the clinical practice: from 'via regia to the \\nunconscious' of Freudian theories - an expression of repressed infantile wishes \\nof libidinal or aggressive drive nature - it becomes the very fulcrum of the \\nanalysis, a fundamental capacity to be developed, a necessary and decisive \\nelement for the patient's transformation. The dream can also be use with the \\nfunction of thinking and mentalization, of problem solving, of adaptation, as \\nwell as an indicator of the relationship with the therapist in the analytic \\ndialogue or of dissociated aspects of the self. Finally, the author proposes a \\nchallenging reading of the clinical relevance of dream: through listening to the \\ndream, the clinician can help the patient to stand in the spaces of his own self \\nin a more open and fluid way and therefore to know himself better, to regulate \\nhis affects, to think and to integrate oneself. A dream which is not interpreted \\nis like a letter which is not read (Babylonian Talmud, tractate Berakhòt, folio \\n55a) A man is shown [a dream] only from the thoughts of his heart (Babylonian \\nTalmud, tractate Berakhòt, folio 55b).\"],\n",

Four of Freud\\'s major dreams reveal an instigatory experience \\nconsisting of a contemporaneous ego-ideal conflict due to an anticipation of \\nprofessional status as denied or lost. This contemporaneous ego-ideal conflict \\nresonates with early and unconscious shame dynamics and shame fantasies \\ninvolving tension from the ego-ideal that result from Freud\\'s seeing himself as \\nrelegated to inferior or asexual status. The wish to possess an object of desire \\nwas not primary in any of these dreams. The complex nexus of shame dynamics, in \\nturn, instigates more visible competitive wishes; these strive to alter the \\ncircumstances that threaten to give rise to shame or turn the tables on the \\nshamer. The instigating shame dynamics are thus screened by the more visible \\ndynamics of hostile competition.

Remarkably, however, this has never been \\ndemonstrated, as waking experiences are never truly replicated in sleep but \\nrather appear in very altered or distorted forms.

Telepathy- suffering (or intense feeling) at a distance (Greek: \\npathos + tele)-is the transfer or communication of thoughts, impressions and \\ninformation over distance between two people without the normal operation of the \\nrecognized sense organs. The author offers a comprehensive historical review of \\nthe psychoanalytic literature on this controversial issue, beginning with \\nFreud's years-long struggles over the possibility of thoughttransference and \\ndream telepathy. She then describes her own analytic encounter over the years \\nwith five patients' telepathic dreams-dreams involving precise details of the \\ntime, place, sensory impressions, and experiential states that the analyst was \\nin at that time, which the patients could not have known through ordinary \\nsensory perception and communication. The author's ensuing explanation combines \\ncontributory factors involving patient, archaic communication and analyst. Each \\nof these patients, in early childhood, had a mother who was emotionally \\nabsent-within-absence, due to the absence of a significant figure in her own \\nlife. This primary traumatic loss was imprinted in their nascent selves and \\ninchoate relating to others, with a fixation on a nonverbal, archaic mode of \\ncommunication. The patient's telepathic dream is formed as a search engine when \\nthe analyst is suddenly emotionally absent, in order to find the analyst and \\nthus halt the process of abandonment and prevent collapse into the despair of \\nthe early traumatization. Hence, the telepathic dream embodies an enigmatic \\n'impossible' extreme of patient-analyst deep-level interconnectedness and \\nunconscious communication in the analytic process.

In this, his initial formulation of unconscious \\nmental activity, he was attempting to account for the nature of dreaming, by \\ninference for the mind of infancy and, more speculatively, for adult psychosis. \\nHe never revised the model in light of his later formulations of the structural \\nmodel and the death instinct, nor did he elaborate on his speculation that it \\ncould serve as a model for psychosis, and there has been little subsequent \\neffort to employ the model outside the context of dreaming.

              " [\"In summary, I think Freud's idea is that the prime mover of psychic life is the \\nunconscious wish, not phantasy. The 'work' of making phantasies and the 'work' \\nof making dreams are parallel processes in which forbidden unconscious wishes \\nachieve disguised expression and partial fulfilment. For Freud himself, \\nespecially in his central usage, and even more for his immediate followers, \\nphantasies are conceived as imagined fulfilments of frustrated wishes. Whether \\nthey originate in the system conscious or the system preconscious, they are an \\nactivity of the ego and are formed according to the principles of the secondary \\nprocess. That is not the whole story, however, because phantasies may get \\nrepressed into the system unconscious, where they become associated with the \\ninstinctual wishes, become subject to the laws of the primary process, and may \\nfind their way into dreams and many other derivatives. For Freud and for French \\npsychoanalysts particularly, there are the primal phantasies, 'unconscious all \\nalong', of the primal scene, castration and seduction, also capable of being \\ndirectly incorporated into dreams and expressed through other derivatives. For \\nKlein phantasy is an even more central concept than for Freud and it has \\ncontinued to be used by her successors with only minor changes. In Klein's \\nthinking unconscious phantasies play the part that Freud assigned to the \\nunconscious wish. They underlie dreams rather than being parallel to them--a \\nmuch more inclusive definition of phantasy than Freud's. The earliest and most \\ndeeply unconscious phantasies are bodily, and only gradually, with maturation \\nand developing experience through introjection and projection do some of them \\ncome to take a verbal form. Freud's central usage, the wish-fulfilling \\ndefinition of phantasy, is a particular type of phantasy within Klein's more \\ninclusive definition. And, as in Freud's formulation, conscious phantasies may \\nbe repressed, but in Klein's formulation this is not the only or even the main \\nsource of unconscious phantasies. In Klein's usage, unconscious phantasies \\nunderlie not only dreams but all thought and activity, both creative and \\ndestructive, including the expression of internal object relations in the \\nanalytic situation. Finally, it is my tentative suggestion that conceptual and \\nclinical focus on the concept of phantasy, especially unconscious phantasy, as \\nin Britain and France, tends to involve a heightened awareness of the \\nunconscious--hardly surprising, since unconscious phantasy is such a fundamental \\naspect of the unconscious. I have suggested that, although there are many \\nindividual variations, the structural model and the self-psychology, relational \\nand intersubjectivist models tend to discourage focus on the dynamic \\nunconscious.\"],\n",

According to the anesthetic protocol there were also \\nthree subgroups: etomidate &amp; sevoflurane, propofol &amp; sevoflurane, propofol &amp; \\npropofol groups. Primary outcome measure was the incidence of postoperative \\ndreams in the non-intervention group and in the three groups receiving different \\npsychological interventions. Secondary endpoint was to test the effect of \\nperioperative suggestions and dreamfilm-formation training on the occurrance of \\ndreams and recallable dreams in different general anesthesiological techniques.\\nRESULTS: Dream incidence rates measured in the control group did not differ \\nsignificantly (etomidate &amp; sevoflurane: 40%, propofol &amp; sevoflurane: 26%, \\npropofol &amp; propofol: 39%). A significant increase could be observed in the \\nincidence rate of dreams between the control and suggestion groups in the \\npropofol &amp; sevoflurane (26%-52%) group (p = 0.023).

Charcot regarded hypnosis as an artificially \\ninduced hysterical neurosis, and it was he who first introduced Freud to these \\ntwo states. Freud was the first to see in hypnosis an experimental instrument \\nfor understanding psychopathological mechanisms. His subsequent \\nconceptualization of psychoanalysis derived from these two phenomena at this \\ndecisive period.

In recent years some psychoanalysts have become interested in \\nhypnosis, which one of them described as a focus for psychophysiological and \\npsychoanalytic investigations. Any theory of the psychical apparatus which does \\nnot account for such an obvious psychical phenomenon must necessarily be \\nincomplete. Since Charcot, hysteria presents hardly any new openings for \\nexperimental work. It is suggested that the solution of psyche-soma interaction \\nmight be sought in the study of hypnosis. It is postulated that hypnosis is a \\n\"fourth organismic state,\" not as yet objectifiable (in contradistinction to the \\nwaking state, sleep, and dreaming): a kind of natural or inborn mechanism which \\nacts as one of the regulators of man\\'s relationships with the environment.

An important \\nquestion that remains to be addressed is the temporal relationship between \\ndisrupted sleep and cannabis use. This literature review summarizes the existing \\nliterature on the association between disrupted sleep and cannabis toward the \\ngoal of addressing the question of the chronology of these reported effects. \\nMaterials and Methods: We conducted a review of the literature using PubMed to \\nsummarize current knowledge on the association between cannabis use and sleep in \\nhumans. Results: We identified 31 studies on the association of cannabis use and \\nsleep. The findings from these studies were mixed. Cannabis was associated with \\na variety of impacts on sleep ranging from beneficial effects, such as reduced \\nsleep-onset latency, to negative outcomes, such as reduced sleep duration and \\nsuppressed rapid eye movement oscillations. The chronology of the interaction of \\ncannabis and sleep was unclear, although much of the current literature focus on \\nfactors that modulate how cannabis impairs sleep after initial use. Conclusion: \\nThere was sufficient evidence to suggest that cannabis use alters circadian \\nrhythms, and hence, negatively impacts sleep. The current literature is largely \\nfrom studies utilizing self-report measures of sleep; thus, objective measures \\nof sleep are needed. In addition, although there were no empirical studies on \\nthe temporal relationship between cannabis use and sleep, the majority of the \\nliterature focused on characterizing sleep impairment after cannabis use.'],\n",

Thus, dreams have been addressed from a number of \\ndifferent perspectives ranging from philosophy to clinical medicine, as well as \\npsychiatry, psychology, artificial intelligence, neural network models, \\npsychophysiology or neurobiology.\\nDEVELOPMENT: The main models are grounded on the biological function of dreams, \\nespecially those based on processes involving the consolidation of memory and \\nforgetting, and models of simulation. Similarly, current models are developed \\nupon the neurobiology and the neuropsychology of the REM phases of sleep and how \\nthey are differentiated from wakefulness. Thus, neurobiologically speaking, \\ndreams are related to the role of acetylcholine and, neuropsychologically, to \\nthe activation of the limbic and paralimbic regions, the activation of the basal \\nganglia, the activation of cortical areas with a specific modality (especially \\nBrodmann's areas 19, 22 and 37) and the deactivation of the ventromedial, \\nparietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Dreams can be considered a state of consciousness that is \\ncharacterised by a reduced control over their content, visual images and \\nactivation of the memory, and which is mediated by motivational incentives and \\nemotional salience.\"],\n",

The \\nrelationships between the experience of DD, dream content (\"active\" vs \\n\"passive\"), and affect and craving were analyzed using mixed model methods.\\nRESULTS: The experience of DD was associated with higher levels of negative \\naffect (P &lt; 0.001) and craving (P &lt; 0.001). The occurrence of DD did not \\ndecrease significantly over the 5 weeks of the study.

To further investigate the \\neffectiveness of this combined approach, we conducted a sleep laboratory \\nexperiment with four different conditions. The general experimental procedure \\nwas the following: Participants were awakened after 6 h of sleep from a \\nsubsequent REM period and kept awake for 30 or 60 min, during which they were \\nasked to practice MILD or a control task (e.g., reading). Then they returned to \\nbed for a morning sleep period. In the first condition eleven sport students, \\nwho attended a seminar on sleep and dreams, spent one night in a sleep \\nlaboratory. To avoid biases due to the seminar attendance (e.g., higher \\nmotivation), in the second condition 15 participants who did not attend the \\nseminar were recruited. In the third condition, 14 sport students were tested \\nwith a shorter awakening period (30 min). Finally, the fourth condition served \\nas a control condition, whereas eleven sport students slept two non-consecutive \\nnights in a laboratory. Instead of MILD, in one night the participants read a \\nbook (fiction, unrelated to dreams), while in the other night they played a \\nNintendo Wii video game.

Four of Freud\\'s major dreams reveal an instigatory experience \\nconsisting of a contemporaneous ego-ideal conflict due to an anticipation of \\nprofessional status as denied or lost. This contemporaneous ego-ideal conflict \\nresonates with early and unconscious shame dynamics and shame fantasies \\ninvolving tension from the ego-ideal that result from Freud\\'s seeing himself as \\nrelegated to inferior or asexual status. The wish to possess an object of desire \\nwas not primary in any of these dreams. The complex nexus of shame dynamics, in \\nturn, instigates more visible competitive wishes; these strive to alter the \\ncircumstances that threaten to give rise to shame or turn the tables on the \\nshamer. The instigating shame dynamics are thus screened by the more visible \\ndynamics of hostile competition. This formulation offers an expanded view of the \\ndynamics of instigation which leads to a more balanced understanding of the \\nnature and components of instigatory shame dynamics and their relationship to \\nthe dynamics of conflicts involving hostility, competition, and guilt.'],\n",

For the first time, direct and systematic investigation \\ncould be made of such topics as the occurrence, qualities, recollection, and \\nchildhood development of dreaming. Experimental methodologies permitted \\ninvestigation of the responsiveness of dreams to external stimulation and the \\neffects of deprivation of REM sleep. Much effort was devoted to searching for \\nparallels between physiological aspects of REM sleep and characteristics of \\nassociated dreams, with modest results. The leading theory of dreaming in the \\nearly decades of this research was the psychoanalytic, which views dreams as \\nhighly meaningful reflections of unconscious mental functioning. With \\ndevelopments in understanding of the neurophysiology of REM sleep, new theories \\nof dreaming were proposed. The most prominent, the activation-synthesis \\nhypothesis, derived its view of dreaming directly from the neurophysiology of \\nREM sleep, in particular the role of the brain stem, and in its original form \\nregarded dreams as not essentially meaningful. Further developments in \\nneurobiological research, including lesion and brain imaging studies, have \\nestablished a clearer view of the functional neuroanatomy of REM sleep and \\ndreaming. To what degree, and in what way, implications can be drawn from these \\nfindings for the psychology of dreaming is controversial. Some more recent \\ntheories of dreaming emphasize an adaptive function related to emotion and a \\nrole in learning and memory consolidation.'],\n",

The relationship between pre-post sleep memory \\nperformance improvements and learning-related dream incorporation was \\ninvestigated (N = 24) to determine if this relationship could be explained by \\ninter-individual differences in intellectual abilities (e.g., reasoning, short \\nterm memory (STM), and verbal abilities).

The \\nepisode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement \\nof these differences to a clinically overt level.

New data obtained by means of evoked \\npotential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional \\nperiod that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral \\nreactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the \\nindividual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues, \\novert terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout \\nsleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These \\nchanges may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date, \\nit has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological \\nactivity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological \\nvoid in sleep just preceding the attacks.

I \\nintroduce a pluralist approach to dream content that highlights the \\nphilosophical and empirical implications of treating dreaming as a highly varied \\nexperience that can be anywhere on a spectrum from truly bizarre and incoherent \\nto wake-like and mundane. Here I discuss several explanations for why theorists \\ndisagree on whether dreams should be defined as primarily bizarre or convincing, \\nreal-world simulations. Rating scales can underestimate or overestimate \\nbizarreness depending on the variables of the scale and interpretation of \\ncontextual factors. Although double blind analysis of dream reports is assumed \\nto be the most accurate method of quantifying dream bizarreness, contextual \\nfactors can only be clarified by the dreamer themselves, since only they can \\njudge whether an event would be bizarre in their own lives, however the dreamer \\nmight find elements bizarre after waking that they did not find unusual during \\nthe dream.

              "2400  [In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism, \\nthe nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from \\nslow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement \\ndreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that \\nphysiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the \\nindividual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The \\nepisode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement \\nof these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are \\ncommon to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be \\nattributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked \\npotential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional \\nperiod that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral \\nreactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the \\nindividual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues, \\novert terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout \\nsleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These \\nchanges may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date, \\nit has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological \\nactivity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological \\nvoid in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even \\ndaytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any \\nsolid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the \\nresults of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for \\nexample, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from \\nsatisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders \\nof arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for \\nthese attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent \\narousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful \\npossibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of \\nthose physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of \\nattacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these \\nchanges by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined \\ninvestigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the \\nprocess of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.]   \n",

Here I discuss several explanations for why theorists  disagree on whether dreams should be defined as primarily bizarre or convincing,  real-world simulations. Rating scales can underestimate or overestimate  bizarreness depending on the variables of the scale and interpretation of  contextual factors. Although double blind analysis of dream reports is assumed  to be the most accurate method of quantifying dream bizarreness, contextual  factors can only be clarified by the dreamer themselves, since only they can  judge whether an event would be bizarre in their own lives, however the dreamer  might find elements bizarre after waking that they did not find unusual during  the dream. Dreams can at times be so bizarre and incoherent that that they are  difficult or impossible to report accurately, mundane and indistinguishable from  waking life or anything in-between. Both bizarre and mundane dreams should be of  great interest to philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists.']</td>\n",

Original data are reported here which indicate that  physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the  individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The  episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement  of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are  common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be  attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked  potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional  period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral  reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the  individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues,  overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout  sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These  changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date,  it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological  activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological  void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even  daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any  solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the  results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for  example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from  satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders  of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for  these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent  arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful  possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of  those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of  attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these  changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined  investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the  process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.']</td>\n",

The aims of  this study were to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances, particularly  insomnia and nightmares, and their prospective associations with the risk of  suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. METHODS: A naturalistic longitudinal study was conducted in outpatients  diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders recruited from the psychiatric  outpatient clinic of a regional university-affiliated public hospital in Hong  Kong. A detailed sleep questionnaire was completed by 388 patients at baseline  in May-June 2006. Relevant clinical information was extracted from clinical case  notes from June 2007-October 2014. RESULTS: Prevalence of frequent insomnia and frequent nightmares was 19% and 9%,  respectively. Baseline frequent insomnia was significantly associated with an  increased incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period (adjusted  hazard ratio = 4.63, 95% confidence interval 1.40-15.36, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Nightmare  complaint alone did not predict the occurrence of suicide attempts, but the  comorbidity of nightmares and insomnia was associated with the risk of suicide  attempt over follow-up (adjusted HR = 11.10, 95% confidence interval:  1.68-73.43, P &amp;lt; 0.05).

I  introduce a pluralist approach to dream content that highlights the  philosophical and empirical implications of treating dreaming as a highly varied  experience that can be anywhere on a spectrum from truly bizarre and incoherent  to wake-like and mundane. Here I discuss several explanations for why theorists  disagree on whether dreams should be defined as primarily bizarre or convincing,  real-world simulations. Rating scales can underestimate or overestimate  bizarreness depending on the variables of the scale and interpretation of  contextual factors. Although double blind analysis of dream reports is assumed  to be the most accurate method of quantifying dream bizarreness, contextual  factors can only be clarified by the dreamer themselves, since only they can  judge whether an event would be bizarre in their own lives, however the dreamer  might find elements bizarre after waking that they did not find unusual during  the dream. Dreams can at times be so bizarre and incoherent that that they are  difficult or impossible to report accurately, mundane and indistinguishable from  waking life or anything in-between. Both bizarre and mundane dreams should be of  great interest to philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists.']   \n",

Thanks to recent progress in neuroimaging techniques, it is now  becoming possible to relate dream features to specific patterns of brain  activity. Some conditions occurring in patients with neurological disorders,  such as lucid dreams and parasomnias, not only have diagnostic value, but also  offer a window into the dream process. They show that dreaming is reflected in  physiological signals, behaviours, and brain activity patterns, and that the  body can enact dream content. Yet, the dream body can also be distinct from the  real body; in their dreams, patients with congenital paraplegia can walk, those  with sleep apnoea rarely suffocate, and phantom limb pain can disappear. These  conditions provide valuable models for future studies investigating the  mechanisms that underlie oneiric experiences.']   \n",

Thirty-five studies were included in the analysis (11 sleep  laboratory and 24 field studies), of which 26 employed cognitive techniques, 11  external stimulation and one drug application. The methodological quality of the  included studies was relatively low. None of the induction techniques were  verified to induce lucid dreams reliably and consistently, although some of them  look promising.

              "2400  ['In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism,  the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from  slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement  dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that  physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the  individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The  episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement  of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are  common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be  attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked  potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional  period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral  reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the  individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues,  overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout  sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These  changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date,  it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological  activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological  void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even  daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any  solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the  results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for  example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from  satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders  of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for  these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent  arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful  possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of  those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of  attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these  changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined  investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the  process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.']   \n",

A careful sleep history, drug history,  general medical assessment, and psychiatric evaluation along with an appraisal  of the interplay between the patient's condition and his environment can provide  all of the elements needed for diagnosis and treatment formulation. The main  components of the sleep history include: defining the specific sleep problem,  assessing the disorder's clinical course, differentiating between sleep  disorders, evaluating the sleep-wakefulness patterns, questioning the bed  partner, and obtaining a family history of sleep disorders. The drug history  provides important information regarding the role of various medications, which  may cause sleep difficulty during their administration or following withdrawal.  Implementing a complete medical assessment is necessary for the identification  of certain medical conditions that may be associated with sleep disorders.  Finally, a thorough psychiatric evaluation and assessment of the psychosocial  consequences of the patient's disorder should be conducted. In general, sleep  laboratory diagnostic studies are of limited usefulness. These studies are  indicated primarily when sleep apnea is suspected or when the sleep attacks of  narcolepsy are present in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.\"]   \n",

The aims of  this study were to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances, particularly  insomnia and nightmares, and their prospective associations with the risk of  suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. METHODS: A naturalistic longitudinal study was conducted in outpatients  diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders recruited from the psychiatric  outpatient clinic of a regional university-affiliated public hospital in Hong  Kong. A detailed sleep questionnaire was completed by 388 patients at baseline  in May-June 2006. Relevant clinical information was extracted from clinical case  notes from June 2007-October 2014. RESULTS: Prevalence of frequent insomnia and frequent nightmares was 19% and 9%,  respectively. Baseline frequent insomnia was significantly associated with an  increased incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period (adjusted  hazard ratio = 4.63, 95% confidence interval 1.40-15.36, P &lt; 0.05). Nightmare  complaint alone did not predict the occurrence of suicide attempts, but the  comorbidity of nightmares and insomnia was associated with the risk of suicide  attempt over follow-up (adjusted HR = 11.10, 95% confidence interval:  1.68-73.43, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances are common in patients with  schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The association between sleep disturbances and  suicidal risk underscores the need for enhanced clinical attention and  intervention on sleep disturbances in patients with schizophrenia.']   \n",

They rarely  point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings  are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and  pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the  anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the  night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur  during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this  helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to  be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep  environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the  child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal  breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance  and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders,  it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g.  psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological  and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).']   \n",

I  introduce a pluralist approach to dream content that highlights the  philosophical and empirical implications of treating dreaming as a highly varied  experience that can be anywhere on a spectrum from truly bizarre and incoherent  to wake-like and mundane. Here I discuss several explanations for why theorists  disagree on whether dreams should be defined as primarily bizarre or convincing,  real-world simulations. Rating scales can underestimate or overestimate  bizarreness depending on the variables of the scale and interpretation of  contextual factors. Although double blind analysis of dream reports is assumed  to be the most accurate method of quantifying dream bizarreness, contextual  factors can only be clarified by the dreamer themselves, since only they can  judge whether an event would be bizarre in their own lives, however the dreamer  might find elements bizarre after waking that they did not find unusual during  the dream. Dreams can at times be so bizarre and incoherent that that they are  difficult or impossible to report accurately, mundane and indistinguishable from  waking life or anything in-between. Both bizarre and mundane dreams should be of  great interest to philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists.</td>\n",

Original data are reported here which indicate that  physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the  individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The  episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement  of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are  common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be  attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked  potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional  period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral  reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the  individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues,  overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout  sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These  changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date,  it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological  activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological  void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even  daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any  solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the  results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for  example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from  satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders  of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for  these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent  arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful  possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of  those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of  attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these  changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined  investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the  process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.</td>\n",

The drug history  provides important information regarding the role of various medications, which  may cause sleep difficulty during their administration or following withdrawal.

The aims of  this study were to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances, particularly  insomnia and nightmares, and their prospective associations with the risk of  suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. METHODS: A naturalistic longitudinal study was conducted in outpatients  diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders recruited from the psychiatric  outpatient clinic of a regional university-affiliated public hospital in Hong  Kong. A detailed sleep questionnaire was completed by 388 patients at baseline  in May-June 2006. Relevant clinical information was extracted from clinical case  notes from June 2007-October 2014. RESULTS: Prevalence of frequent insomnia and frequent nightmares was 19% and 9%,  respectively. Baseline frequent insomnia was significantly associated with an  increased incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period (adjusted  hazard ratio = 4.63, 95% confidence interval 1.40-15.36, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Nightmare  complaint alone did not predict the occurrence of suicide attempts, but the  comorbidity of nightmares and insomnia was associated with the risk of suicide  attempt over follow-up (adjusted HR = 11.10, 95% confidence interval:  1.68-73.43, P &amp;lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances are common in patients with  schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The association between sleep disturbances and  suicidal risk underscores the need for enhanced clinical attention and  intervention on sleep disturbances in patients with schizophrenia.</td>\n",

Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings  are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and  pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the  anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the  night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur  during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this  helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to  be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep  environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the  child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal  breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance  and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders,  it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g.  psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological  and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).</td>\n",

I  introduce a pluralist approach to dream content that highlights the  philosophical and empirical implications of treating dreaming as a highly varied  experience that can be anywhere on a spectrum from truly bizarre and incoherent  to wake-like and mundane. Here I discuss several explanations for why theorists  disagree on whether dreams should be defined as primarily bizarre or convincing,  real-world simulations. Rating scales can underestimate or overestimate  bizarreness depending on the variables of the scale and interpretation of  contextual factors. Although double blind analysis of dream reports is assumed  to be the most accurate method of quantifying dream bizarreness, contextual  factors can only be clarified by the dreamer themselves, since only they can  judge whether an event would be bizarre in their own lives, however the dreamer  might find elements bizarre after waking that they did not find unusual during  the dream. Dreams can at times be so bizarre and incoherent that that they are  difficult or impossible to report accurately, mundane and indistinguishable from  waking life or anything in-between. Both bizarre and mundane dreams should be of  great interest to philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists.   \n",

They show that the human brain,  disconnected from the environment, can generate an entire world of conscious  experiences by itself. Content analysis and developmental studies have promoted  understanding of dream phenomenology. In parallel, brain lesion studies,  functional imaging and neurophysiology have advanced current knowledge of the  neural basis of dreaming. It is now possible to start integrating these two  strands of research to address fundamental questions that dreams pose for  cognitive neuroscience: how conscious experiences in sleep relate to underlying  brain activity; why the dreamer is largely disconnected from the environment;  and whether dreaming is more closely related to mental imagery or to perception.   \n",

Thanks to recent progress in neuroimaging techniques, it is now  becoming possible to relate dream features to specific patterns of brain  activity. Some conditions occurring in patients with neurological disorders,  such as lucid dreams and parasomnias, not only have diagnostic value, but also  offer a window into the dream process. They show that dreaming is reflected in  physiological signals, behaviours, and brain activity patterns, and that the  body can enact dream content. Yet, the dream body can also be distinct from the  real body; in their dreams, patients with congenital paraplegia can walk, those  with sleep apnoea rarely suffocate, and phantom limb pain can disappear. These  conditions provide valuable models for future studies investigating the  mechanisms that underlie oneiric experiences.   \n",

Hobson and Kahns (Hobson, J. A., &amp; Kahn, D. (2007). Dream  content: Individual and generic aspects. Consciousness and Cognition, 16,  850-858.) conclusion that dream content may be more generic than most  researchers realize, and that individual differences are less salient than  usually thought, provides the occasion for a review of findings based on the  Hall and Van de Castle (Hall, C., &amp; Van de Castle, R. (1966). The content  analysis of dreams. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.) coding system for the  study of dream content. Then new findings based on a computationally intensive  randomization strategy are presented to show the minimum sample sizes needed to  detect gender and individual differences in dream content. Generally speaking,  sample sizes of 100-125 dream reports are needed because most dream elements  appear in less than 50% of dream reports and the magnitude of the differences  usually is not large.   \n",

Lucid dreaming is a learnable skill and a variety of  techniques is suggested for lucid dreaming induction. This systematic review  evaluated the evidence for the effectiveness of induction techniques. A  comprehensive literature search was carried out in biomedical databases and  specific resources. Thirty-five studies were included in the analysis (11 sleep  laboratory and 24 field studies), of which 26 employed cognitive techniques, 11  external stimulation and one drug application. The methodological quality of the  included studies was relatively low. None of the induction techniques were  verified to induce lucid dreams reliably and consistently, although some of them  look promising.

              "2400  In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism,  the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from  slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement  dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that  physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the  individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The  episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement  of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are  common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be  attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked  potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional  period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral  reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the  individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues,  overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout  sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These  changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date,  it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological  activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological  void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even  daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any  solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the  results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for  example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from  satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders  of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for  these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent  arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful  possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of  those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of  attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these  changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined  investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the  process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.   \n",

A careful sleep history, drug history,  general medical assessment, and psychiatric evaluation along with an appraisal  of the interplay between the patients condition and his environment can provide  all of the elements needed for diagnosis and treatment formulation. The main  components of the sleep history include: defining the specific sleep problem,  assessing the disorders clinical course, differentiating between sleep  disorders, evaluating the sleep-wakefulness patterns, questioning the bed  partner, and obtaining a family history of sleep disorders. The drug history  provides important information regarding the role of various medications, which  may cause sleep difficulty during their administration or following withdrawal.  Implementing a complete medical assessment is necessary for the identification  of certain medical conditions that may be associated with sleep disorders.  Finally, a thorough psychiatric evaluation and assessment of the psychosocial  consequences of the patients disorder should be conducted. In general, sleep  laboratory diagnostic studies are of limited usefulness. These studies are  indicated primarily when sleep apnea is suspected or when the sleep attacks of  narcolepsy are present in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.   \n",

The aims of  this study were to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances, particularly  insomnia and nightmares, and their prospective associations with the risk of  suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. METHODS: A naturalistic longitudinal study was conducted in outpatients  diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders recruited from the psychiatric  outpatient clinic of a regional university-affiliated public hospital in Hong  Kong. A detailed sleep questionnaire was completed by 388 patients at baseline  in May-June 2006. Relevant clinical information was extracted from clinical case  notes from June 2007-October 2014. RESULTS: Prevalence of frequent insomnia and frequent nightmares was 19% and 9%,  respectively. Baseline frequent insomnia was significantly associated with an  increased incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period (adjusted  hazard ratio = 4.63, 95% confidence interval 1.40-15.36, P &lt; 0.05). Nightmare  complaint alone did not predict the occurrence of suicide attempts, but the  comorbidity of nightmares and insomnia was associated with the risk of suicide  attempt over follow-up (adjusted HR = 11.10, 95% confidence interval:  1.68-73.43, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances are common in patients with  schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The association between sleep disturbances and  suicidal risk underscores the need for enhanced clinical attention and  intervention on sleep disturbances in patients with schizophrenia.   \n",

They rarely  point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings  are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and  pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the  anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the  night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur  during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this  helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to  be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep  environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the  child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal  breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance  and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders,  it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g.  psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological  and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).   \n",

We addressed this gap in the literature using data from the Avon  Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Participants included 6050  adolescents (51.4% female) who completed the UK Childhood Interview for DSM-IV  BPD at 11 to 12years of age. Nightmares and sleep onset and maintenance  problems were prospectively assessed via mother report when children were 2.5,  3.5, 4.8 and 6.8years of age. Psychopathological (i.e., emotional temperament;  psychiatric diagnoses; and emotional and behavioural problems) and psychosocial  (i.e., abuse, maladaptive parenting, and family adversity) confounders were  assessed via mother report. In logistic regressions, persistent nightmares  (i.e., regular nightmares at 3 or more time-points) were significantly  associated with BPD symptoms following adjustment for sleep onset and  maintenance problems and all confounders (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.62; 95 %  Confidence Interval = 1.12 to 2.32). Persistent sleep onset and maintenance  problems were not significantly associated with BPD symptoms. In path analysis  controlling for all associations between confounders, persistent nightmares  independently predicted BPD symptoms (Probit co-efficient β=0.08,  p=0.013). Emotional and behavioural problems significantly mediated the  association between nightmares and BPD (β =0.016, p&lt;0.001), while nightmares  significantly mediated associations between emotional temperament (β=0.001,  p=0.018), abuse (β=0.015, p=0.018), maladaptive parenting (β=0.002,  p=0.021) and subsequent BPD. These findings tentatively support that childhood  nightmares may potentially increase the risk of BPD symptoms in early  adolescence via a number of aetiological pathways. If replicated, the current  findings could have important implications for early intervention, and assist  clinicians in the identification of children at risk of developing BPD.   \n",

I  introduce a pluralist approach to dream content that highlights the  philosophical and empirical implications of treating dreaming as a highly varied  experience that can be anywhere on a spectrum from truly bizarre and incoherent  to wake-like and mundane. Here I discuss several explanations for why theorists  disagree on whether dreams should be defined as primarily bizarre or convincing,  real-world simulations. Rating scales can underestimate or overestimate  bizarreness depending on the variables of the scale and interpretation of  contextual factors. Although double blind analysis of dream reports is assumed  to be the most accurate method of quantifying dream bizarreness, contextual  factors can only be clarified by the dreamer themselves, since only they can  judge whether an event would be bizarre in their own lives, however the dreamer  might find elements bizarre after waking that they did not find unusual during  the dream. Dreams can at times be so bizarre and incoherent that that they are  difficult or impossible to report accurately, mundane and indistinguishable from  waking life or anything in-between. Both bizarre and mundane dreams should be of  great interest to philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists.   \n",

They show that the human brain,  disconnected from the environment, can generate an entire world of conscious  experiences by itself. Content analysis and developmental studies have promoted  understanding of dream phenomenology. In parallel, brain lesion studies,  functional imaging and neurophysiology have advanced current knowledge of the  neural basis of dreaming. It is now possible to start integrating these two  strands of research to address fundamental questions that dreams pose for  cognitive neuroscience: how conscious experiences in sleep relate to underlying  brain activity; why the dreamer is largely disconnected from the environment;  and whether dreaming is more closely related to mental imagery or to perception.   \n",

Thanks to recent progress in neuroimaging techniques, it is now  becoming possible to relate dream features to specific patterns of brain  activity. Some conditions occurring in patients with neurological disorders,  such as lucid dreams and parasomnias, not only have diagnostic value, but also  offer a window into the dream process. They show that dreaming is reflected in  physiological signals, behaviours, and brain activity patterns, and that the  body can enact dream content. Yet, the dream body can also be distinct from the  real body; in their dreams, patients with congenital paraplegia can walk, those  with sleep apnoea rarely suffocate, and phantom limb pain can disappear. These  conditions provide valuable models for future studies investigating the  mechanisms that underlie oneiric experiences.   \n",

Hobson and Kahns (Hobson, J. A., &amp; Kahn, D. (2007). Dream  content: Individual and generic aspects. Consciousness and Cognition, 16,  850-858.) conclusion that dream content may be more generic than most  researchers realize, and that individual differences are less salient than  usually thought, provides the occasion for a review of findings based on the  Hall and Van de Castle (Hall, C., &amp; Van de Castle, R. (1966). The content  analysis of dreams. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.) coding system for the  study of dream content. Then new findings based on a computationally intensive  randomization strategy are presented to show the minimum sample sizes needed to  detect gender and individual differences in dream content. Generally speaking,  sample sizes of 100-125 dream reports are needed because most dream elements  appear in less than 50% of dream reports and the magnitude of the differences  usually is not large.   \n",

Lucid dreaming is a learnable skill and a variety of  techniques is suggested for lucid dreaming induction. This systematic review  evaluated the evidence for the effectiveness of induction techniques. A  comprehensive literature search was carried out in biomedical databases and  specific resources. Thirty-five studies were included in the analysis (11 sleep  laboratory and 24 field studies), of which 26 employed cognitive techniques, 11  external stimulation and one drug application. The methodological quality of the  included studies was relatively low. None of the induction techniques were  verified to induce lucid dreams reliably and consistently, although some of them  look promising. On the basis of the reviewed studies, a taxonomy of lucid dream  induction methods is presented. Several methodological issues are discussed and  further directions for future studies are proposed.   \n",

              "2400  In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism,  the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from  slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement  dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that  physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the  individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The  episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement  of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are  common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be  attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked  potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional  period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral  reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the  individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues,  overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout  sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These  changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date,  it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological  activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological  void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even  daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any  solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the  results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for  example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from  satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders  of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for  these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent  arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful  possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of  those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of  attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these  changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined  investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the  process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.   \n",

A careful sleep history, drug history,  general medical assessment, and psychiatric evaluation along with an appraisal  of the interplay between the patients condition and his environment can provide  all of the elements needed for diagnosis and treatment formulation. The main  components of the sleep history include: defining the specific sleep problem,  assessing the disorders clinical course, differentiating between sleep  disorders, evaluating the sleep-wakefulness patterns, questioning the bed  partner, and obtaining a family history of sleep disorders. The drug history  provides important information regarding the role of various medications, which  may cause sleep difficulty during their administration or following withdrawal.  Implementing a complete medical assessment is necessary for the identification  of certain medical conditions that may be associated with sleep disorders.  Finally, a thorough psychiatric evaluation and assessment of the psychosocial  consequences of the patients disorder should be conducted. In general, sleep  laboratory diagnostic studies are of limited usefulness. These studies are  indicated primarily when sleep apnea is suspected or when the sleep attacks of  narcolepsy are present in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.   \n",

The aims of  this study were to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances, particularly  insomnia and nightmares, and their prospective associations with the risk of  suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. METHODS: A naturalistic longitudinal study was conducted in outpatients  diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders recruited from the psychiatric  outpatient clinic of a regional university-affiliated public hospital in Hong  Kong. A detailed sleep questionnaire was completed by 388 patients at baseline  in May-June 2006. Relevant clinical information was extracted from clinical case  notes from June 2007-October 2014. RESULTS: Prevalence of frequent insomnia and frequent nightmares was 19% and 9%,  respectively. Baseline frequent insomnia was significantly associated with an  increased incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period (adjusted  hazard ratio = 4.63, 95% confidence interval 1.40-15.36, P &lt; 0.05). Nightmare  complaint alone did not predict the occurrence of suicide attempts, but the  comorbidity of nightmares and insomnia was associated with the risk of suicide  attempt over follow-up (adjusted HR = 11.10, 95% confidence interval:  1.68-73.43, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances are common in patients with  schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The association between sleep disturbances and  suicidal risk underscores the need for enhanced clinical attention and  intervention on sleep disturbances in patients with schizophrenia.   \n",

They rarely  point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings  are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and  pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the  anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the  night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur  during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this  helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to  be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep  environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the  child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal  breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance  and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders,  it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g.  psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological  and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).   \n",

Whether nightmares and  sleep-onset and maintenance problems predate BPD symptoms earlier in development  is unknown. We addressed this gap in the literature using data from the Avon  Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Participants included 6050  adolescents (51.4% female) who completed the UK Childhood Interview for DSM-IV  BPD at 11 to 12years of age. Nightmares and sleep onset and maintenance  problems were prospectively assessed via mother report when children were 2.5,  3.5, 4.8 and 6.8years of age. Psychopathological (i.e., emotional temperament;  psychiatric diagnoses; and emotional and behavioural problems) and psychosocial  (i.e., abuse, maladaptive parenting, and family adversity) confounders were  assessed via mother report. In logistic regressions, persistent nightmares  (i.e., regular nightmares at 3 or more time-points) were significantly  associated with BPD symptoms following adjustment for sleep onset and  maintenance problems and all confounders (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.62; 95 %  Confidence Interval = 1.12 to 2.32). Persistent sleep onset and maintenance  problems were not significantly associated with BPD symptoms. In path analysis  controlling for all associations between confounders, persistent nightmares  independently predicted BPD symptoms (Probit co-efficient β=0.08,  p=0.013). Emotional and behavioural problems significantly mediated the  association between nightmares and BPD (β =0.016, p&lt;0.001), while nightmares  significantly mediated associations between emotional temperament (β=0.001,  p=0.018), abuse (β=0.015, p=0.018), maladaptive parenting (β=0.002,  p=0.021) and subsequent BPD. These findings tentatively support that childhood  nightmares may potentially increase the risk of BPD symptoms in early  adolescence via a number of aetiological pathways. If replicated, the current  findings could have important implications for early intervention, and assist  clinicians in the identification of children at risk of developing BPD.   \n",

I  introduce a pluralist approach to dream content that highlights the  philosophical and empirical implications of treating dreaming as a highly varied  experience that can be anywhere on a spectrum from truly bizarre and incoherent  to wake-like and mundane. Here I discuss several explanations for why theorists  disagree on whether dreams should be defined as primarily bizarre or convincing,  real-world simulations. Rating scales can underestimate or overestimate  bizarreness depending on the variables of the scale and interpretation of  contextual factors. Although double blind analysis of dream reports is assumed  to be the most accurate method of quantifying dream bizarreness, contextual  factors can only be clarified by the dreamer themselves, since only they can  judge whether an event would be bizarre in their own lives, however the dreamer  might find elements bizarre after waking that they did not find unusual during  the dream. Dreams can at times be so bizarre and incoherent that that they are  difficult or impossible to report accurately, mundane and indistinguishable from  waking life or anything in-between. Both bizarre and mundane dreams should be of  great interest to philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists.</td>\n",

              "      <td>In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism,  the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from  slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement  dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that  physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the  individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The  episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement  of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are  common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be  attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked  potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional  period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral  reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the  individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues,  overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout  sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These  changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date,  it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological  activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological  void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even  daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any  solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the  results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for  example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from  satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders  of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for  these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent  arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful  possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of  those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of  attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these  changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined  investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the  process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.</td>\n",

A careful sleep history, drug history,  general medical assessment, and psychiatric evaluation along with an appraisal  of the interplay between the patients condition and his environment can provide  all of the elements needed for diagnosis and treatment formulation. The main  components of the sleep history include: defining the specific sleep problem,  assessing the disorders clinical course, differentiating between sleep  disorders, evaluating the sleep-wakefulness patterns, questioning the bed  partner, and obtaining a family history of sleep disorders. The drug history  provides important information regarding the role of various medications, which  may cause sleep difficulty during their administration or following withdrawal.  Implementing a complete medical assessment is necessary for the identification  of certain medical conditions that may be associated with sleep disorders.  Finally, a thorough psychiatric evaluation and assessment of the psychosocial  consequences of the patients disorder should be conducted. In general, sleep  laboratory diagnostic studies are of limited usefulness. These studies are  indicated primarily when sleep apnea is suspected or when the sleep attacks of  narcolepsy are present in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.</td>\n",

The aims of  this study were to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances, particularly  insomnia and nightmares, and their prospective associations with the risk of  suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. METHODS: A naturalistic longitudinal study was conducted in outpatients  diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders recruited from the psychiatric  outpatient clinic of a regional university-affiliated public hospital in Hong  Kong. A detailed sleep questionnaire was completed by 388 patients at baseline  in May-June 2006. Relevant clinical information was extracted from clinical case  notes from June 2007-October 2014. RESULTS: Prevalence of frequent insomnia and frequent nightmares was 19% and 9%,  respectively. Baseline frequent insomnia was significantly associated with an  increased incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period (adjusted  hazard ratio = 4.63, 95% confidence interval 1.40-15.36, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Nightmare  complaint alone did not predict the occurrence of suicide attempts, but the  comorbidity of nightmares and insomnia was associated with the risk of suicide  attempt over follow-up (adjusted HR = 11.10, 95% confidence interval:  1.68-73.43, P &amp;lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances are common in patients with  schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The association between sleep disturbances and  suicidal risk underscores the need for enhanced clinical attention and  intervention on sleep disturbances in patients with schizophrenia.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Sleep disorders in childhood are frequent and usually harmless. They rarely  point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings  are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and  pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the  anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the  night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur  during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this  helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to  be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep  environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the  child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal  breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance  and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders,  it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g.  psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological  and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).</td>\n",

              "      <td>Sleep disorders, such as insomnia and nightmares, are commonly associated with  Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in adulthood. Whether nightmares and  sleep-onset and maintenance problems predate BPD symptoms earlier in development  is unknown. We addressed this gap in the literature using data from the Avon  Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Participants included 6050  adolescents (51.4% female) who completed the UK Childhood Interview for DSM-IV  BPD at 11 to 12years of age. Nightmares and sleep onset and maintenance  problems were prospectively assessed via mother report when children were 2.5,  3.5, 4.8 and 6.8years of age. Psychopathological (i.e., emotional temperament;  psychiatric diagnoses; and emotional and behavioural problems) and psychosocial  (i.e., abuse, maladaptive parenting, and family adversity) confounders were  assessed via mother report. In logistic regressions, persistent nightmares  (i.e., regular nightmares at 3 or more time-points) were significantly  associated with BPD symptoms following adjustment for sleep onset and  maintenance problems and all confounders (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.62; 95 %  Confidence Interval = 1.12 to 2.32). Persistent sleep onset and maintenance  problems were not significantly associated with BPD symptoms. In path analysis  controlling for all associations between confounders, persistent nightmares  independently predicted BPD symptoms (Probit co-efficient β=0.08,  p=0.013). Emotional and behavioural problems significantly mediated the  association between nightmares and BPD (β =0.016, p&amp;lt;0.001), while nightmares  significantly mediated associations between emotional temperament (β=0.001,  p=0.018), abuse (β=0.015, p=0.018), maladaptive parenting (β=0.002,  p=0.021) and subsequent BPD. These findings tentatively support that childhood  nightmares may potentially increase the risk of BPD symptoms in early  adolescence via a number of aetiological pathways. If replicated, the current  findings could have important implications for early intervention, and assist  clinicians in the identification of children at risk of developing BPD.</td>\n",
