I  introduce a pluralist approach to dream content that highlights the  philosophical and empirical implications of treating dreaming as a highly varied  experience that can be anywhere on a spectrum from truly bizarre and incoherent  to wake-like and mundane. Here I discuss several explanations for why theorists  disagree on whether dreams should be defined as primarily bizarre or convincing,  real-world simulations. Rating scales can underestimate or overestimate  bizarreness depending on the variables of the scale and interpretation of  contextual factors. Although double blind analysis of dream reports is assumed  to be the most accurate method of quantifying dream bizarreness, contextual  factors can only be clarified by the dreamer themselves, since only they can  judge whether an event would be bizarre in their own lives, however the dreamer  might find elements bizarre after waking that they did not find unusual during  the dream. Dreams can at times be so bizarre and incoherent that that they are  difficult or impossible to report accurately, mundane and indistinguishable from  waking life or anything in-between. Both bizarre and mundane dreams should be of  great interest to philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists.   \n",

They show that the human brain,  disconnected from the environment, can generate an entire world of conscious  experiences by itself. Content analysis and developmental studies have promoted  understanding of dream phenomenology. In parallel, brain lesion studies,  functional imaging and neurophysiology have advanced current knowledge of the  neural basis of dreaming. It is now possible to start integrating these two  strands of research to address fundamental questions that dreams pose for  cognitive neuroscience: how conscious experiences in sleep relate to underlying  brain activity; why the dreamer is largely disconnected from the environment;  and whether dreaming is more closely related to mental imagery or to perception.   \n",

Thanks to recent progress in neuroimaging techniques, it is now  becoming possible to relate dream features to specific patterns of brain  activity. Some conditions occurring in patients with neurological disorders,  such as lucid dreams and parasomnias, not only have diagnostic value, but also  offer a window into the dream process. They show that dreaming is reflected in  physiological signals, behaviours, and brain activity patterns, and that the  body can enact dream content. Yet, the dream body can also be distinct from the  real body; in their dreams, patients with congenital paraplegia can walk, those  with sleep apnoea rarely suffocate, and phantom limb pain can disappear. These  conditions provide valuable models for future studies investigating the  mechanisms that underlie oneiric experiences.   \n",

Hobson and Kahns (Hobson, J. A., &amp; Kahn, D. (2007). Dream  content: Individual and generic aspects. Consciousness and Cognition, 16,  850-858.) conclusion that dream content may be more generic than most  researchers realize, and that individual differences are less salient than  usually thought, provides the occasion for a review of findings based on the  Hall and Van de Castle (Hall, C., &amp; Van de Castle, R. (1966). The content  analysis of dreams. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.) coding system for the  study of dream content. Then new findings based on a computationally intensive  randomization strategy are presented to show the minimum sample sizes needed to  detect gender and individual differences in dream content. Generally speaking,  sample sizes of 100-125 dream reports are needed because most dream elements  appear in less than 50% of dream reports and the magnitude of the differences  usually is not large.   \n",

Lucid dreaming is a learnable skill and a variety of  techniques is suggested for lucid dreaming induction. This systematic review  evaluated the evidence for the effectiveness of induction techniques. A  comprehensive literature search was carried out in biomedical databases and  specific resources. Thirty-five studies were included in the analysis (11 sleep  laboratory and 24 field studies), of which 26 employed cognitive techniques, 11  external stimulation and one drug application. The methodological quality of the  included studies was relatively low. None of the induction techniques were  verified to induce lucid dreams reliably and consistently, although some of them  look promising.

              "2359  In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism,  the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from  slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement  dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that  physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the  individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The  episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement  of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are  common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be  attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked  potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional  period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral  reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the  individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues,  overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout  sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These  changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date,  it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological  activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological  void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even  daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any  solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the  results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for  example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from  satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders  of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for  these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent  arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful  possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of  those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of  attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these  changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined  investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the  process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.   \n",

A careful sleep history, drug history,  general medical assessment, and psychiatric evaluation along with an appraisal  of the interplay between the patients condition and his environment can provide  all of the elements needed for diagnosis and treatment formulation. The main  components of the sleep history include: defining the specific sleep problem,  assessing the disorders clinical course, differentiating between sleep  disorders, evaluating the sleep-wakefulness patterns, questioning the bed  partner, and obtaining a family history of sleep disorders. The drug history  provides important information regarding the role of various medications, which  may cause sleep difficulty during their administration or following withdrawal.  Implementing a complete medical assessment is necessary for the identification  of certain medical conditions that may be associated with sleep disorders.  Finally, a thorough psychiatric evaluation and assessment of the psychosocial  consequences of the patients disorder should be conducted. In general, sleep  laboratory diagnostic studies are of limited usefulness. These studies are  indicated primarily when sleep apnea is suspected or when the sleep attacks of  narcolepsy are present in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.   \n",

The aims of  this study were to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances, particularly  insomnia and nightmares, and their prospective associations with the risk of  suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. METHODS: A naturalistic longitudinal study was conducted in outpatients  diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders recruited from the psychiatric  outpatient clinic of a regional university-affiliated public hospital in Hong  Kong. A detailed sleep questionnaire was completed by 388 patients at baseline  in May-June 2006. Relevant clinical information was extracted from clinical case  notes from June 2007-October 2014. RESULTS: Prevalence of frequent insomnia and frequent nightmares was 19% and 9%,  respectively. Baseline frequent insomnia was significantly associated with an  increased incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period (adjusted  hazard ratio = 4.63, 95% confidence interval 1.40-15.36, P &lt; 0.05). Nightmare  complaint alone did not predict the occurrence of suicide attempts, but the  comorbidity of nightmares and insomnia was associated with the risk of suicide  attempt over follow-up (adjusted HR = 11.10, 95% confidence interval:  1.68-73.43, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances are common in patients with  schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The association between sleep disturbances and  suicidal risk underscores the need for enhanced clinical attention and  intervention on sleep disturbances in patients with schizophrenia.   \n",

They rarely  point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings  are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and  pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the  anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the  night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur  during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this  helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to  be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep  environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the  child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal  breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance  and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders,  it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g.  psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological  and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).   \n",

We addressed this gap in the literature using data from the Avon  Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Participants included 6050  adolescents (51.4% female) who completed the UK Childhood Interview for DSM-IV  BPD at 11 to 12years of age. Nightmares and sleep onset and maintenance  problems were prospectively assessed via mother report when children were 2.5,  3.5, 4.8 and 6.8years of age. Psychopathological (i.e., emotional temperament;  psychiatric diagnoses; and emotional and behavioural problems) and psychosocial  (i.e., abuse, maladaptive parenting, and family adversity) confounders were  assessed via mother report. In logistic regressions, persistent nightmares  (i.e., regular nightmares at 3 or more time-points) were significantly  associated with BPD symptoms following adjustment for sleep onset and  maintenance problems and all confounders (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.62; 95 %  Confidence Interval = 1.12 to 2.32). Persistent sleep onset and maintenance  problems were not significantly associated with BPD symptoms. In path analysis  controlling for all associations between confounders, persistent nightmares  independently predicted BPD symptoms (Probit co-efficient β=0.08,  p=0.013). Emotional and behavioural problems significantly mediated the  association between nightmares and BPD (β =0.016, p&lt;0.001), while nightmares  significantly mediated associations between emotional temperament (β=0.001,  p=0.018), abuse (β=0.015, p=0.018), maladaptive parenting (β=0.002,  p=0.021) and subsequent BPD. These findings tentatively support that childhood  nightmares may potentially increase the risk of BPD symptoms in early  adolescence via a number of aetiological pathways. If replicated, the current  findings could have important implications for early intervention, and assist  clinicians in the identification of children at risk of developing BPD.   \n",

I  introduce a pluralist approach to dream content that highlights the  philosophical and empirical implications of treating dreaming as a highly varied  experience that can be anywhere on a spectrum from truly bizarre and incoherent  to wake-like and mundane. Here I discuss several explanations for why theorists  disagree on whether dreams should be defined as primarily bizarre or convincing,  real-world simulations. Rating scales can underestimate or overestimate  bizarreness depending on the variables of the scale and interpretation of  contextual factors. Although double blind analysis of dream reports is assumed  to be the most accurate method of quantifying dream bizarreness, contextual  factors can only be clarified by the dreamer themselves, since only they can  judge whether an event would be bizarre in their own lives, however the dreamer  might find elements bizarre after waking that they did not find unusual during  the dream. Dreams can at times be so bizarre and incoherent that that they are  difficult or impossible to report accurately, mundane and indistinguishable from  waking life or anything in-between. Both bizarre and mundane dreams should be of  great interest to philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists.   \n",

They show that the human brain,  disconnected from the environment, can generate an entire world of conscious  experiences by itself. Content analysis and developmental studies have promoted  understanding of dream phenomenology. In parallel, brain lesion studies,  functional imaging and neurophysiology have advanced current knowledge of the  neural basis of dreaming. It is now possible to start integrating these two  strands of research to address fundamental questions that dreams pose for  cognitive neuroscience: how conscious experiences in sleep relate to underlying  brain activity; why the dreamer is largely disconnected from the environment;  and whether dreaming is more closely related to mental imagery or to perception.   \n",

Thanks to recent progress in neuroimaging techniques, it is now  becoming possible to relate dream features to specific patterns of brain  activity. Some conditions occurring in patients with neurological disorders,  such as lucid dreams and parasomnias, not only have diagnostic value, but also  offer a window into the dream process. They show that dreaming is reflected in  physiological signals, behaviours, and brain activity patterns, and that the  body can enact dream content. Yet, the dream body can also be distinct from the  real body; in their dreams, patients with congenital paraplegia can walk, those  with sleep apnoea rarely suffocate, and phantom limb pain can disappear. These  conditions provide valuable models for future studies investigating the  mechanisms that underlie oneiric experiences.   \n",

Hobson and Kahns (Hobson, J. A., &amp; Kahn, D. (2007). Dream  content: Individual and generic aspects. Consciousness and Cognition, 16,  850-858.) conclusion that dream content may be more generic than most  researchers realize, and that individual differences are less salient than  usually thought, provides the occasion for a review of findings based on the  Hall and Van de Castle (Hall, C., &amp; Van de Castle, R. (1966). The content  analysis of dreams. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.) coding system for the  study of dream content. Then new findings based on a computationally intensive  randomization strategy are presented to show the minimum sample sizes needed to  detect gender and individual differences in dream content. Generally speaking,  sample sizes of 100-125 dream reports are needed because most dream elements  appear in less than 50% of dream reports and the magnitude of the differences  usually is not large.   \n",

Lucid dreaming is a learnable skill and a variety of  techniques is suggested for lucid dreaming induction. This systematic review  evaluated the evidence for the effectiveness of induction techniques. A  comprehensive literature search was carried out in biomedical databases and  specific resources. Thirty-five studies were included in the analysis (11 sleep  laboratory and 24 field studies), of which 26 employed cognitive techniques, 11  external stimulation and one drug application. The methodological quality of the  included studies was relatively low. None of the induction techniques were  verified to induce lucid dreams reliably and consistently, although some of them  look promising. On the basis of the reviewed studies, a taxonomy of lucid dream  induction methods is presented.

              "2359  In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism,  the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from  slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement  dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that  physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the  individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The  episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement  of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are  common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be  attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked  potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional  period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral  reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the  individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues,  overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout  sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These  changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date,  it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological  activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological  void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even  daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any  solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the  results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for  example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from  satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders  of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for  these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent  arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful  possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of  those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of  attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these  changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined  investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the  process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.   \n",

A careful sleep history, drug history,  general medical assessment, and psychiatric evaluation along with an appraisal  of the interplay between the patients condition and his environment can provide  all of the elements needed for diagnosis and treatment formulation. The main  components of the sleep history include: defining the specific sleep problem,  assessing the disorders clinical course, differentiating between sleep  disorders, evaluating the sleep-wakefulness patterns, questioning the bed  partner, and obtaining a family history of sleep disorders. The drug history  provides important information regarding the role of various medications, which  may cause sleep difficulty during their administration or following withdrawal.  Implementing a complete medical assessment is necessary for the identification  of certain medical conditions that may be associated with sleep disorders.  Finally, a thorough psychiatric evaluation and assessment of the psychosocial  consequences of the patients disorder should be conducted. In general, sleep  laboratory diagnostic studies are of limited usefulness. These studies are  indicated primarily when sleep apnea is suspected or when the sleep attacks of  narcolepsy are present in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.   \n",

The aims of  this study were to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances, particularly  insomnia and nightmares, and their prospective associations with the risk of  suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. METHODS: A naturalistic longitudinal study was conducted in outpatients  diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders recruited from the psychiatric  outpatient clinic of a regional university-affiliated public hospital in Hong  Kong. A detailed sleep questionnaire was completed by 388 patients at baseline  in May-June 2006. Relevant clinical information was extracted from clinical case  notes from June 2007-October 2014. RESULTS: Prevalence of frequent insomnia and frequent nightmares was 19% and 9%,  respectively. Baseline frequent insomnia was significantly associated with an  increased incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period (adjusted  hazard ratio = 4.63, 95% confidence interval 1.40-15.36, P &lt; 0.05). Nightmare  complaint alone did not predict the occurrence of suicide attempts, but the  comorbidity of nightmares and insomnia was associated with the risk of suicide  attempt over follow-up (adjusted HR = 11.10, 95% confidence interval:  1.68-73.43, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances are common in patients with  schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The association between sleep disturbances and  suicidal risk underscores the need for enhanced clinical attention and  intervention on sleep disturbances in patients with schizophrenia.   \n",

They rarely  point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings  are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and  pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the  anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the  night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur  during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this  helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to  be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep  environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the  child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal  breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance  and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders,  it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g.  psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological  and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).   \n",

Participants included 6050  adolescents (51.4% female) who completed the UK Childhood Interview for DSM-IV  BPD at 11 to 12years of age. Nightmares and sleep onset and maintenance  problems were prospectively assessed via mother report when children were 2.5,  3.5, 4.8 and 6.8years of age. Psychopathological (i.e., emotional temperament;  psychiatric diagnoses; and emotional and behavioural problems) and psychosocial  (i.e., abuse, maladaptive parenting, and family adversity) confounders were  assessed via mother report. In logistic regressions, persistent nightmares  (i.e., regular nightmares at 3 or more time-points) were significantly  associated with BPD symptoms following adjustment for sleep onset and  maintenance problems and all confounders (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.62; 95 %  Confidence Interval = 1.12 to 2.32). Persistent sleep onset and maintenance  problems were not significantly associated with BPD symptoms. In path analysis  controlling for all associations between confounders, persistent nightmares  independently predicted BPD symptoms (Probit co-efficient β=0.08,  p=0.013). Emotional and behavioural problems significantly mediated the  association between nightmares and BPD (β =0.016, p&lt;0.001), while nightmares  significantly mediated associations between emotional temperament (β=0.001,  p=0.018), abuse (β=0.015, p=0.018), maladaptive parenting (β=0.002,  p=0.021) and subsequent BPD. These findings tentatively support that childhood  nightmares may potentially increase the risk of BPD symptoms in early  adolescence via a number of aetiological pathways. If replicated, the current  findings could have important implications for early intervention, and assist  clinicians in the identification of children at risk of developing BPD.   \n",

The aims of  this study were to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances, particularly  insomnia and nightmares, and their prospective associations with the risk of  suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. METHODS: A naturalistic longitudinal study was conducted in outpatients  diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders recruited from the psychiatric  outpatient clinic of a regional university-affiliated public hospital in Hong  Kong. A detailed sleep questionnaire was completed by 388 patients at baseline  in May-June 2006. Relevant clinical information was extracted from clinical case  notes from June 2007-October 2014. RESULTS: Prevalence of frequent insomnia and frequent nightmares was 19% and 9%,  respectively. Baseline frequent insomnia was significantly associated with an  increased incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period (adjusted  hazard ratio = 4.63, 95% confidence interval 1.40-15.36, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Nightmare  complaint alone did not predict the occurrence of suicide attempts, but the  comorbidity of nightmares and insomnia was associated with the risk of suicide  attempt over follow-up (adjusted HR = 11.10, 95% confidence interval:  1.68-73.43, P &amp;lt; 0.05).

While the largely harmless somnambulism and  pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the  anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the  night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur  during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this  helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to  be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep  environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the  child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal  breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance  and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders,  it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g.  psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological  and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).</td>\n",

              "      <td>Sleep disorders, such as insomnia and nightmares, are commonly associated with  Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in adulthood. Whether nightmares and  sleep-onset and maintenance problems predate BPD symptoms earlier in development  is unknown. We addressed this gap in the literature using data from the Avon  Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Participants included 6050  adolescents (51.4% female) who completed the UK Childhood Interview for DSM-IV  BPD at 11 to 12years of age. Nightmares and sleep onset and maintenance  problems were prospectively assessed via mother report when children were 2.5,  3.5, 4.8 and 6.8years of age. Psychopathological (i.e., emotional temperament;  psychiatric diagnoses; and emotional and behavioural problems) and psychosocial  (i.e., abuse, maladaptive parenting, and family adversity) confounders were  assessed via mother report. In logistic regressions, persistent nightmares  (i.e., regular nightmares at 3 or more time-points) were significantly  associated with BPD symptoms following adjustment for sleep onset and  maintenance problems and all confounders (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.62; 95 %  Confidence Interval = 1.12 to 2.32). Persistent sleep onset and maintenance  problems were not significantly associated with BPD symptoms. In path analysis  controlling for all associations between confounders, persistent nightmares  independently predicted BPD symptoms (Probit co-efficient β=0.08,  p=0.013). Emotional and behavioural problems significantly mediated the  association between nightmares and BPD (β =0.016, p&amp;lt;0.001), while nightmares  significantly mediated associations between emotional temperament (β=0.001,  p=0.018), abuse (β=0.015, p=0.018), maladaptive parenting (β=0.002,  p=0.021) and subsequent BPD. These findings tentatively support that childhood  nightmares may potentially increase the risk of BPD symptoms in early  adolescence via a number of aetiological pathways. If replicated, the current  findings could have important implications for early intervention, and assist  clinicians in the identification of children at risk of developing BPD.</td>\n",

In the course of their studies, medical researchers have demonstrated  that about 80% patients, woken up at their Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep phase,  can remember their own dreams, whereas, in clinical practice, young adults can  remember their dreams on their awakenings only once or twice a week. Let us now  come to the point: in this study we suggest some hypotheses that could explain  the reason why patients suffering from psychosomatic disorders seem to remember  dreams much less frequently than healthy individuals.   \n",

But with  myriad stages of sleep, forms of memory and processes of memory encoding and  consolidation, sorting out how sleep contributes to memory has been anything but  straightforward. Nevertheless, converging evidence, from the molecular to the  phenomenological, leaves little doubt that offline memory reprocessing during  sleep is an important component of how our memories are formed and ultimately  shaped.   \n",
